MS„ but also in the MS. belonging to Pembroke
College‚ Cambridge. It is one of the many pleasures
connected with this work that it has brought me the
privilege of his friendship. In relation to the last-
named MS. I have to acknowledge the courtesy of
the College Librarian‚ Mr. Neil.

At the British Museum my special thanks are due
to Mr. F . Biekley, not only for constant help in my
researches‚ but for sending me written information
on various points when Ι was prevented by illness
from going up to London myself. The Dean and
Chapter 01 Durham kindly allowed their MS. of Bede
to be deposited in the Bodleian 101 my use3 to them
and to their learned Librarian, Dr W. Greenwell, my
best thanks are due. I am also indebted to my
brother, Dr. A. Plummer, for verifying 101· me some
points which I had overlooked. A like service was
done me at &Vinchester by the Librarian‚ the Rev.
F. T. Madge. My original examination of the Win-
chester MS. was made under the hospitable roof 01
my dear friend, Dr. Kitchin, now transferred to a
sphere of wider usefulness at Durham. At Namur
special facilities were given me by the director and
librarian of the municipal library and museum,
M. Becket and M. Mahieu.

To 1110 Delegates of the Clarendon Press I am in-
debted 101 entrusting me with the execution of this
edition, which has occupied my chief energies for
some four years. It is no light privilege to have
been for so long a time in constant communion with
one 01 1110 saintliest characters ever produced by the
Church 01 Christ in this island. I can but adapt the
words of St. Ignatius‚ and Say: εὔχομαι μὴ εἰς μαρτύριον
αὐτὸ κτήσωμαι (Philad. c. 6).
