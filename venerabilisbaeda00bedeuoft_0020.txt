vi Eclitor’s Preface.

In the Dedication I have tried to express, imper-
feetly enough, obligations of a more general kind to
those College friends to whom Ι have owed so much
happiness during more than a quarter of a century of
College life. Will they allow me to close this prefaoe
with the words with which Ceolfrid parted from his
monks (p. 397): ‘Domine . . . protege illam cohortem!
Seio autem certissime quia nullos umquam meliores
illis . . . noui'Z
