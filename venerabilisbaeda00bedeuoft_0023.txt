BEDE’S

LIFE AND WORKS.

ξ 1. ALMosT all that We know of the life of Bede is Betle‘s

contained in the little notice of himself and his works Εῗέξὲἕέ

which he has appended to the Ecclesiastical History¹:
‘Thus much concerning the eeclesiastical history of
Britain, and especially of the race of the English, I,
Baeda, a servant of Christ and priest of the monastery
of the blessed aposffles, st. Peter and st. Paul, which is at
Wearniouth and at Jarrow, have with the Lord's help
oomposed, so far as Ι could gather it, either from ancient
docunients‚ or from the tradition of the elders⁷ or from

my own knowledge.

I was born in the territory*2 of the

said monastery7 and at the age of seven ³ I was, by the care

dam epilogo comprehendens)
W. M. i. 60.

2 ‘ In territorio eiusdem nio-
uastam-iij ‘ on sundurlonde paes
ylcan mynstres,’ As. vers. Does
this imply that Bede was born
at the place still called Sunder-
land i> The same* suggestion
was made by Gelile, Disputatio
. . . de Bedae . . . uita et scriptis,
Lugd. Batau. 1838. The oom-
mon tradition is that Bede was
born at Monkton, where a well
called Bede’s Well still exists.
Cf. Murray's Durham and North-
umberland (1873), p. 134. With
this would agree fairly the state—

though Monkton is not actually
on the Tyne. The expression used.
by Bede must mean that he was
born on land which afterwards
belonged to the monastery, as at
the time of his birth even Wear-
mouth had not been founded,
niueh less Jarrow. v infraq p. xi.

prototype of them all is ‘the
