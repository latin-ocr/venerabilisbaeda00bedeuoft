There are points in the description to which 1 shall recm-
later. For the present we may note that as the Ecclesi-
astical History was written in 731, Bede’s birth must be
placed in 672 or 673, his entrance into the monastery in
679 or 680, his ordination as deacon in 691 or 692, and
his ordination as priest in 702 or 70 3 ¹.

Bede’s death (rightly, as I be-
