ξ 5.] Becle's Life a‘ncl Works.

Ceolfrid ¹, is inconsistent, not only with Bede’s words cited
above, but with his total silence in all his works as to any
such visit ²3 though in two of his works he tells us how in
701 certain of the brethren‚ of whom Hwaetbert was 0119.
were in Rome on a mission from Ceolfrid, and brought
back a privilege for the monastery from Pope Sergius “·.

§5. We can form from Bede’s own writings a very monasti-
fair idea of that monastic life to which he dedicated him- fggffiffgdi„
3911ο with such single-hearted devotion. On his entry {sismun-
into the monastery at the age of seven he would be placed ι’

110 doubt in the monastic school ⁴. Resides his own
words as to the delight which he took in learning, and
the evidence of his own works, we have the testimony of
Alcuin to his diligence as a young student. In a letter
written to the monks of WVearmouth and J arrow in 793
he urges their younger members by the example of Bede
to be diligent in study and devotion, and not to spend

their time in digging out foxes or coursing hares ⁵. Bede

² S. D. i. 41, 227 expressly
says that he never crossed the
sea. All this of course does not
prove that he was not invited.
But even this is very doubtful.
See XVerner, pp. 85, 86. The

subjects of study in such scliools‚

exist of the schools at York
founded by Bede’s friend, arch-

bishop Egbert. e. g. Vita Alcuini.

Sometimes monks might be
sent to another monastery to
be educated. Cf. a papal privi-
lege granted to the monastery
of St. Bertin, at St. Omer, in
the 'thirteenth century z ‘ quod
in monasterio nostro possimus
habere clericum, qui pro mona-
