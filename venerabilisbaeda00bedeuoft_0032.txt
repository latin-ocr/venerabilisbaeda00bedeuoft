foundation of the learning of XVearmouth and Jarrow
must have been laid by Benedict himself 2, who besides
his training at Lerins, and his frequent visits to Rome, had
accompanied Archbishop Theodore and Abbot Hadrian to
Britain in 669, and had remained two years at Canter-
bury as Abbot of st. Peter’s monastery in that city 3.

There Theodore and Hadrian gathered together a
flourishing school of disciples, whom they instructed, not
only in the Scriptures, but in the art of metre, astronomy,
and ecclesiastical computation. Some of their disciples,
who were alive when Bede wrote the Ecclesiastical History
in 731, knew Latin and Greek no less well than their native
language 4. It is interesting to note, what we shall see
afterwards more clearly, that these are just the subjects
on which Bede wrote some of his more important works ⁵.
There would be further the traditions of the learning of
the Irish monks of Iona, by whom Northumbria was
reconverted after the apostasy which followed the death
of Edwin in 633.

brought back from the Continent to enrich and adorn his
monasteries none were more important for the development
of the future scholar than the library of books, which was
added to by Abbot Ceolfrid0. Among the books given
