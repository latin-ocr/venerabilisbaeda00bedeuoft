§6.] Becle's Life apid Worlcs. xix

by the latter are expressly noted three copies of the new
translation of the Bible (the Vulgate) and one of the old
(the Itala). Bede, who in his commentar-ies is constantly
comparing the two translations together ¹, may often have
used these very copies. One of the three Vulgates was
taken by Ceolfrid with him on his departure as a present
to the Pope 3 and this has been identified beyond a doubt
with the famous Codex Amiatinus of the Vulgate 2. There
is moreover abundant evidence of the existence of a system
of lending MSS. from one monastery to another for the
purpose of transcription and comparison 3. The latter
process has left its mark on many MSS. which have come
down to us. Thus two of the oldest MSS. of Bede’s
Ecclesiastical History have evidently been compared to-
gether, and the readings of one transferred to the other ⁴.

i. 227 z ‘ habuerat prae oculis et
copiam omnis generis librorum,
quos abbas suus Benedictus inter
alia diuersa ornamenta dona-
tione apostolicorum Uitaliani
et Agathonis, in monasterium
suum contulerat.’ Cf. XVerner,
p. 28. Opp. ix. 388, cited infra,
p. xxiii. Dr. Sanday in his
Bampton Lectures, p. 9, has
thrown out a sugges-‘cive hint on
the influence of great librar-ies
on schools of learning. See an
