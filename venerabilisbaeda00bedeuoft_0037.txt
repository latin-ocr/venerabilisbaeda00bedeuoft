§7.] Bede’s Lffe ccml Worlus. xxiii
one desire is to benefit othere, he has little care to claim
originality for himself. He takes freely from preceding
writers whatever he thinks useful for his purpose ¹, though
he has a much greater sense of literary property than is at
all common among mediaeval writers, ‘being anxious lest
he should be said to steal the sayings of the elders, and
give them out as his own ².’ With this object he begs the
copyists of his theological works to preserve the indica-
tions which he has placed in the margins, of the sources
from which he borrowed3 a request which they have
totally ignored 3. In the same way in his historica}

works he freely uses, and here with less acknowledge-

 

252, 315. 357. One reason which
Bede gives for writing his com-
mentaries is the great expense
of the original works on which
they were based: ‘tam copiosa,
ut uix, nisi a locupletioribus tot
uolumina acquiri . .. ualeant.’
Opp. vii. 1. 2. Bede knew what it
was to suffer from want of books;
speaking of Paterius' catena of
passages from Gregory’s works
explanatory of Holy Scripture,
he says ε ‘quod opus si haberem
ad. manuS, facilius mult-o . .
studium meae uoluntatis imple-
rem ; uerum . . . necdum illud
merui uide1·e,’ix. 388. Hence he
is anxious to popularise the
knowledge which he has ac-
quired: ‘ ut ad plurimos res ipsa
perueniat: vi. 140. Another
reason is the distance of himself
and his readers from the pheno—
mena described, ix. 200; a passage
cited by S. D. i. 228, and given in
the notes to H. E. v. 15 aclfin. Cf.
on all this VVernenpp. 35—37, 195.

¹ Cf. H. E. v. 24, p. 357, sup.
p. x.

2 ‘Sollicitus per omnia ne
maiorum dicta furari, et haec

quasi inea propria componere
dicar! Opp. x. 269.

3 ‘Multumque obsecro . . ,111
si qui forte nostra . . . opuscula
transscriptione digna duxerint,
memorata quoque nominum sig-
na, ut in nostro exemplari re-
periunt, adfigere meminerint‚'
ib. 3 to the same effect, ib. 2. 3.
Cf. VVerner. p. 195 : ‘ Selbst in
den iiltesten Handschriften
fehlen die Namenszeichen der
benfitzten Erkliirer.' A really
critical edition of Bede which
should show exactly how much
he borrowed, and how much is
original is a great desideratum 3
‘necdum illud merui uidere!
Failing such an edition we are
always in danger of citing some-
thing as Bede’s which he merely
borrowed from a predecessor;
and the extracts given in these
notes must all be taken subject
to that possibility. Stin, even so,
they may be treated as charac-
teristic of Bede’s mind, as he
would not have embodied any-
thing which did not coincide

with his own thought and feel-
ing.
