his plan.

The infiuence of Bede as a teacher extended far
beyond those countrymen, whom he primarily desired
to benefit. His pupil, Archbishop Egbert, founded the
famous school of York. In that school was trained
Alcuin, who at the Court of Charles the Great largely
founded the Frankish system of education ². St. Boniface
in the letter to Hwaetbert quoted above rightly speaks
of Bede as ‘shining like a candle of the Church, by his

to ‘priorum scripta,’ H. E., Pref.
p. 6, and a single reference to
Eutropius, i. 8, and Gildas, i. 22,
Bede makes no acknowledgem ent
of the large amount which he
borrows in the first book of the
H.E. from Orosius (i. 276, 8-1113,
Gildas i, 8, 12-16, 22), and Con-
stantius’ Life of Germanus (i.
17—21). The account of St. Alban
is evidently taken from some
‘ Passion’ which has not yet
been discovered. Bede acknow-
ledges his obligation to »the Life
of St. Ful-sa in iii. 193 and to
· that of St. Ethelberg, iv. 7—10.
The latter is not known to exist.
He makes no acknowledgement
of his indebtedness to Eddius’
Life ofWilfrid 3 v. notes to v. 19.
Elsewhere Bede does cite Orosius,
Opp. vii. 145, viii. 4443 cf. also
H. E i. 1, notes.
