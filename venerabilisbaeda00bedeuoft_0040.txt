Tierce, &c.¹ After Matins the monks were allowed to
return to rest23 and as Matins were said somewhere be-

in the middle of the day. St. Cuthbert gently rebukes
those who lost their tempers at being disturbed either in
their nightly or their midday sleep ⁵. The monks slept
in their habits ⁶ ; Cuthbert is said sometimes not to have
taken off his shoes from one Maundy Thursday to another,
when the solemn foot-washing took place 7. In such
cases the performance of this act must have been a real

penance.
