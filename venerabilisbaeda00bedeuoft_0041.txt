and a separate infirmary to which the sick and dying

were removed ¹.

When any member of the community

was known to be near his end, the brethren were assem—
bled in the church to pray sor the departing soul ², and

the same was done after a death ³.

A roll of· departed

members and benefactors called Liber Vitae, or Album
Congregationis was kept 4, and their names were men—

⁴ The Liber Vitae of the

existence, MS. Cotton, Domi-

Oldest English Texts, pp. 153-166.
From the Pref. Vit. Cudb. it ap—
pears that it was the duty of
the ‘ Mansionarius' to enter the
names in the Album Congrega-

tionis. The eommunity of Lin-
disfarne promised Bede that
his name should be entered in
this way, 11).; Opp. Min. pp. 47-
48. So Alcuin to Ethelmld,
abbot ofWearmouth and J arrow:
‘antecessores tui . . . in albo
beatitudinis uestre meae parui-
tatis nomen conscribi iusserunt?

notes. Bede uses these words
with beautiful effect of the
roll of the elect t ‘admonemur
quanta certitudine Dominus
summam electorum in libro
uitae conscribat, et uelut in albo
coeli consignet.' Opp. viii. 376;
‘summus rex . . . congregatos a
mundi plagis omnibus eleetos
suos aeternae beatitudinis albo
conscribit‚’ x. 305. The earliest
known instance of a formal
agreement or confraternity be-
tween different monasteries for
mutual prayer of this kind is
perhaps somewhat later than
Bede's time. H. ἃ* S. iii. 342,
