tioned from time to time in the canon of the Mass, at the
words: ‘Remember also, Lord, thy servants and hand-
maids, N. and N„ who have gone before us with the sign
of saith, and sleep the sleep of peace. To them, Ο Lord,
and to all who rest in Christ, grant, we beseech Thee,
a place of refreshment, light, and peace, through the same
Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen ¹.' And Bede himself
tells us how we ought to embrace all, both living and
dead, in one common charity ²⁷.

Mutua] hospitality between all monasteries seems to
have been regarded as a matter of course ; and Bede sees
in this one fulfilment of Chr1st's promise, that those who
forsake earthly possessions and relations for His sake,
shall receive an hundredfold even in this present world ³.
The guest-house or hospice was a separate building⁷
and the head of this department, the ‘Praepositus
Hospitum,³ was an important officer of the community 4.

The discipline of the monastery was in the hands of
the abbot‚ assisted by the prior, or, as he was then called,
‘ p1·ovost‚’ f praepositus ⁵.’ Implioit obedience to the

official of the guests' quarters at
Lindisfarne is mentioned in

interesting list of officers in the
monastery of St. Hubert in the
Ardennes : ‘organista . . . exte-
