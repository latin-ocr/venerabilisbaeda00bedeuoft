abbot was part of the monastic rule¹. And Bede gives
a beautiful account of the gracious and saintly tact with
which men like Cuthbert, Eosterwine, and Ceolfrid
managed their sometimes troublesome flocks ². Inter-
views with the abbot or prior provoked, no doubt. the
same sort of speculation and comment as interviews
with the president or dean of a college do now. Only
the penalties inflicted would be different. General
admonitions were given by the prior or abbot in an
assembly of all the monksss, and subjects of common
interest were debated there ⁴.

for the abbreviations for ‘prae’
and ‘pro' are very easily con-
fused, became a well-established
form, as is shown by the fact
that it has given us our word
4 provost‚’ AS. profost, pra'fost3
Icel. profastr; Germ. probst3
while the French prevot comes
from ‘p1·aepositus.' This was
the office held by Cuthbert at
Lindisfarne. Vit. Cudb. c. 16;
Opp. Min. p. 79. (XVhether the
‘prioratus’ which Ceolfrid at
VVearmouth was so nearly
throwing up in disgust was the
offic-e of ‘ prior ’ in the technical
sense of the word, may, I think,
be doubted. Hist. Anon. ξ 8,
p. 390. H. δε S. think that the
signature 4 Torhthelm prior’ to
the Council of Clovesho in 825
is ‘the first occurrence of this
title in a contemporary English
document‚’ iii. 600-601. It oc-
curs in a non—monastic sense in
Egbert’s Dialogue, ib. 406.) S. D.
1. 22, speaks of cuthbert. as 4 se-
cundus ab abbate praepositi
iure‚’ ib. 129 : ‘ successit in prae-
positi, id est, prioris officium ’;
cf. ib. 119 (of William of St.
CarilefJ, ‘primo . . . prior
claustri, deinde secundus ab

abbate, maior scilicet prior con-
stituiturs· The very titles of this
officer in the Irish monasteries,
‘secnab‚’ ‘tanaise abbaid' (or
‘tanaise ⁷ alone). imply that he
was 4 secundus ab abbate.' (The
ΕΜ. in 869 and 873 give 4 prioir’
for the ‘ secnab ³ and 4 tanais-e ’
of the Ann. Ult. In 887 they
use 4 13113156 abbaid.5 Dr. Reeves
(Ad. p. 364) translates this last
phrase 4 coadjutor - successor?
Cf. S. C. S. ii. 63.ss
