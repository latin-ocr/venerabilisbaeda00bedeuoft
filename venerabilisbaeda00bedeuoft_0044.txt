§9. The life where the monastic rule was strictly ob-
served must have been a very hard one. The influenoe
of the Irish missionaries had impressed a strongly ascetic
character on the Northunibrian Churoh. Bede tells of an
Irish monk, named Adamnan, in the monastery of colding-
ham, who only touched food twice a week, on Sundays
and Thursdays ¹. Drythelm, the monk of Melrose,who had
the famous vision, would stand up to his loins‚ or some·
times up to his neck, in the river Tweed, reoiting prayers
and psalms, even breaking the ioe in winter to go in, and
letting his cold wet gai-ments dry upon his body ², and
Cuthbert is said to have done the same ³. There can
indeed be little doubt that Cuthbert⁷s mind was unhinged
by the austerities that he p1·aotisecl⁴. Like some of the
wild Covenanteis of whom Scott tells in Old Mortality,
he fancied that he had visible conflicts with the powers of
darkness 5. A story in Bede’s life of him brings out the
hardness of this monastic life in a pathetic manner.
