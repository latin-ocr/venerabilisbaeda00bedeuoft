all temptations.” And I, in saying this, knew no more

storms of temptation. But when the next morning
they left me, and returned to their own monastery
of Lindisfarne, behold, they found that one of their
members had died of the plague3 which increased and
raged for days and months, until within the year
almost the whole of that noble company of fathers and
brethren had departed to the Lord ¹.’
