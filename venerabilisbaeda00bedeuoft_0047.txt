§10.] Bede's Life and Worlcs. xxxiii

But· on the other hand we can see from the story already
quoted of the last days of Benedict and Sigfrid, as well
as from the affectionate ternis in which Bede speaks of

of all prelates upon ea1·th,' bishop Acca ¹, what beautiful
friendships there were, both between men of the sanie
age ², and also between older and younger men 3 ; friend· Α
ships like those which 1 trust we all have known. and
which ought to be among the things foremost in our

this life?

ξ 10. The days in which Bede lived were troublous Declineox
days alike for Church and State in Northumbria. The {fgxsstfflim-
defeat and death of ngrid in the fatal battle of Nechtans- ἒῑγῇρὲ

ginning of Northumbrian decline ⁴. ngrid was succeeded '
by his half-brother AldfricL 3 learned and pious prince.
who ruled over a diminished territory with fair success ⁵.

murder make up the dismal tale of Northumbrian mle ⁶.
