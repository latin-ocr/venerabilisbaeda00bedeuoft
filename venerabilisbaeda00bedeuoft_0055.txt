into connexion with Egbert’s conver-sion of the monks
of Iona to the Roman system our Lord’s words how
Abraham ‘rejoiced to see My day, and he saw it and was
glad ¹.' But the holiest men have their limitations, and
questions even less important have divided Christians ere
now ².

It is in these two works ³ that Bede lays down formally The Sis
the doctrine which he bom-owed from St. Isidore ⁴, of the ἃῆῗῇῌῒ *³¹⁹
six ages of the world⁵; a doctrine which became such
a favourite with him that he introduced it into almost all

his works ἢ.

former work was made the
foundation of an absurd charge
of heresy against Bede, which he
indignantly refutes in an epistle
to Plegwin. Opp. i. 144—154.

to Isidore, that 119 should men-

A translation of extracts from
Isidore was one of Bede's latest
works, inf. p. lxxv. 11 is interest-

The first age is from the Creation to the

Bede next to Isidore in Paradise:
‘Vedi oltre fianuneggiar l'ar-
dente spiro
D’Isidoro, di Beda.’
Parad. x. 130, 131. In his letter
to the Italian Cardinals7 Dante
speaks of Bede as one of his
subjects of study.

that the world would last six
thousand years, answering 10

App. Ff. Ι. ii. 387; but this
form of the theory Bede ex·
pressly refutes in the letter to
Plegwin, speaking of it as due
to a ‘Chronographus haeresi-
arches': ‘iuxta nescio cuius
haeretici librum, quem me
puerum memini antiquo stylo
descriptum uidisse.’ Opp. i.
151, 152, cf.vi. 332, 333. WVhether
these expressions indicate Hip-
polytus himself, or not, I cannot
be sure. The passage is an in-
teresting testimony to the early
age at which Bede began his
chronological studies.
