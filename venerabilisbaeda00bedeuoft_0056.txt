Flood 3 the second from the Flood to Abraham ; the third
from Abraham to David ; the fourth from David to the
Captivity of J udah3 the fifth from the Captivity to the
birth of Christ ; the sixth age iasts until the day of J udge-
ment, and its duration is known to God alone¹. These
six ages, during which the faithful labour for God in this
world, correspond with the six days of God’s labour in
the works of Creation. The seventh age, answering to
His sabbath rest, is that in which the souls of the faithful,
separated from their bodies, rest from their labours in the
unseen world, and is therefore contemporary with all the
other six, beginning when God’s first martyr Abel was
slain, and lasting till the general resurrection, when the
501115 of the faithful being united to their glorious bodies,
the eighth age begins, which lasis for ever ².
