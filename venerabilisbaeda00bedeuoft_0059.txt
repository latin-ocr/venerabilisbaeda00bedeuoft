Ecclesiastical History was written, as we saw, in 7 31.
Besides this there are the Lives of the Abbots of wear>

the divine judgement on Cold-
ingham from Aedgils, a former
priest of that monastery, iv. 25.
p. 266. The miracles of iv. 32
and v. 1 came from the persons
immediately eoneerned, pp. 280,
281. For the miracles of Bishop
John of Hexham his demon
Berthun was the chief authority,
v. 2, 3, 4, 5, pp. 283, 285, 286,
289. 0112 came direct from the
person healed, v. 6, p. 289. The
vision of Drythelm was told to
Bede by Haemgils, a priest who
heard it from Drythelm himself,
v. 12, p. 309. Two other facts
Bede owed to Bishop Pecthehn.
v. 13, 18, pp. 313, 320. Α1 the
end of the H. E. Bede sums up
his authorities under the three
heads of previous writings, the
tradition of the elders, and
personal knowledge, v. 24, pp.
356, 357. For the last, ef. i. 1,
p. 13: ‘uidimus' The ‘traditio
maiorum' is cited also, ii. 1,
p. 79, ef. ib. p. 81. XVhere Bede
gives a story on merely hearsay
evidenee he is careful to state
the fact: thus ‘fertur,' i. 13
ii. 5; iii. 6, 16, 24, 253 iv. 23,
pp- 11, 91, 138, Ι59, 177, Ι82,
253; ‘ferunt,' 111. 5, 10, 12, 16;
iv. 16⁷ 19, 23, pp. 136, 146, 151,
Ι58, 237, 244, 246, 258; ‘per-
hibent,' i. 13 iii. 4, 6; iv. 19,
pp· 11, 133, 137, 2463 ‘per-
hibentu1·,' iv. 14, p. 2323 ‘sunt
qui dieant,’ iv. 19, p. 244. In
the Hist. Abb. Bede cites no
authorities. He was here writ-
ing mainly of matters which
would be within his own per-
sonal knowledge. Neither does

he cite the anonymous Hist.
Abb. which he certainly used.
In the Prose life of Cuthbert
Bede does not cite the Anony-
mous life, though he {illudes to
it, H. Ε. pref. p. 7. On the other
hand he frequently cites his
other authorities: ee. 3 cccl fin„
5 adsim, 6. 23, 25, 30, 35 (alfia,
36 odfin„ 37. Opp. Min. pp. 55,
59, 69, 94, 99, ΙΟἹ, 114, 116- 117·
And 111 1112 Preface to 1112 same
work he gives his reasons for
thus care-fully citing his authori-
ties, ib. pp. 45, 46 (see this
passage in the notes to H. E.
Prefs‘. When therefore Lappen-
berg talk-s of Bede‘s ‘ glaring
lack of historieal criticism,'
‘greller Mangel an historischer
Kritik ¹ (i. 74, E. T. i. 761, 112 15
applying to Bede a totally in-
applieable standard. Professor
Sanday has excellently said with
reference 10 the book of the
Acts that it is hardly reason-
able ‘to require the gift-s of
a German Professor in an early
Christian? Bampton Leetures,
p. 321. Bede's transparent good
saith must be plain to everyone
who reads his narrative. W. M.
calls him ⁶ Beda. adulari nescius:
i. 57. The only point which
ereates a doubt is 1115 suppression
of certain incidents in the life
of wilfrid. see notes to H. E. v.
19. W'hether he did this out of
regard to the memory of wilfrid
or of the kings who opposed
him, I cannot say. Mommsen
says of him: ‘Einen ueras· his-
toricus nennt er 51211 selbst (H. E.
iii. 17), und er hat ein Reeht
