mouth and Jarrow⁷ and the lives in verse and prose of
St. Cuthbert.

The lives of the abbots must have been written after
716. The prose Life of Cuthbert was written probably
about 720. Both in it and in the Lives of the Abbots, Bede
was making use of earlier lives, that ‚of Cuthbert by an
anonymous monk of Lindisfarne, that of the abbots by a
member of his own comm unity of VVearmouth and Jarrow.

In the case of Cuthbert's Life it cannot, I think, be said
that Bede has bettered his original. He has improved the
·. Latinity no doubt, and made the whole thing run more
¹ smoothly. In fact he seems to take delight in altering
the language for the mere sake of alteration, while keep-
ing closely to the sense. But he has obliterated many
interesting details of time and place ¹, he shows a marked
tendency to exaggerate the ascetic and miraculous ele-
ment, he amplifies the narrative with rhetorical matter
which can only be called padding ², inserts as facts ex-
planations of his 011113, and has greatly spoiled one
beautiful anecdote⁴. On the other hand, 1113 account of
Cuthbert's death, derived from an eye-witness, is of real
and independent value ⁵.

compared with the correspond-
ing sections of the Anonymous
life, ἐξ 8, 9, 13. 14, 25, 46. One
object of omitting proper names
of persons and places was to
make it more easy to read such
works in cliurcli or refectory.
It is for the same reason that

we 3ο often find in MSS. the
contractions expanded by a later
hand, and, what many of us ean
sympathise with, the numerals
written out in full. In the
matter of proper names the life
of Columba by Cuimine shows
a striking absence of them as
compared with that byAdamnan ‚
which is partly based upon it.
