xlviii Introduction. [Pam- Ι.
of the gospels for the days on which they were delivered ¹.
Of these homilies the three most interesting are one on
the anniversary of the death of Benedict Biscop, though it
does not add very much to what we learn of him from the
lives by Bede and his anonymous predecessor '2 3 the other
two are for the festivals of the dedication of J arrow or
XVearmouth Church‚ probably the former 3. In connexion
with these homilies of Bede’s may be mentioned a quaint
and beautiful little legend as to the origin of his name of
the venerable ⁴. ‘ After Bede had devoted himself for
a long time to the study of Holy Scripture, in his old age
his eyes became dim, so that he could not see 3 to whom
some mockers said z “ Bede, behold the people are
gathered together waiting to hear the word of God ; arise,
and preach to them.” And he, thil-sting for the salvation
of souis, . .. went up and preached, thinking that there
were people there3 whereas there was no one but those
mockers. And as he concluded his sermon, saying, “ This
may God deign to grant to us, the Father, the Son, and
the Holy Ghost‚” the blessed angels in the air responded‚
saying, ⁴⁴ Amen, very venerable Bede ⁵.'' ²

A slightly different version is found in other authori·

on St. Luke, Monte Casino, Nos.
36, 37, several of the Chapters
are assigned as hoinilies for
definite days. It illustratos the
use made of Bede by later
preachers, that we find a homily
of Bede’s fitted with a new ex-
ordium to conceal its identity.
No. 7 in Giles is, except the first
page and a quarter, identical
with No. 56. Opp. v, 46 ff. , 432 ff.
Needless to say that Dr. Giles
has seen nothing of all this.

homilies in monasteries see &Ver-

Diaconus. Gebhardt‚archbishop
of Salzburg, writing in 1081 says

that Bede's homilies were read
annually in the Church. Libelli
