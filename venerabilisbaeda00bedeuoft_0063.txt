ties, the incident taking place in a stone-strewn valley as
Bede is on a journey, and it is the stones which cry out,
'Amen, uenerabilis Pater-,⁹ The ordinary account of the
origin of the epithet may be given in Fuller’s quaint
words: ‘He is generally surnamed venei-able⁷ but why
authours differ therein—Some say, a. dunce monk⁷ being
to make his epitaph, was non-plussed to make that dactyle,
which is onely of the quorum in the hexameter, and there-
fore at night left the verse, gaping, ‘'Hic sunt in fossa
Bedae . . . ossa‚” till he had consulted with his pillow, to
fill up the hiatus. But returning in the morning, an
angel (we have often heard of their singing, see now ot'
their poetry) had filled up the chasm with ⁴· uenera-
bilis ¹.” ⁹

Most of Bede's theological works are dedicated to Acca,
bishop of Hexham2, for whom he evidently cherished
a warm affecti0n³ ; and as Acca did not become bishop
till 709, these works cannot be earlier than that year.
The latest of his purely theological works would seem to
be the Retractations on the Acts, as it is not mentioned
in the list of Bede’s works at the end of the Ecclesiastical
History written in 7 31 ⁴.

¹ Both these 111103 are found
in a short life printed by Giles,
Opp. Ι. clxi. f. Of the former an
Icelandic version may be seen
printed at the end of Hakonar
Saga, R S. pp. 433, 434. Yet a
fourth legend in Gehle, pp. 36, 37.

at Acca’s request, or in answer
to questions addressed by him.
So also was the hymn on the

Ι. pp. cliii, cliv. In the Mer-
ton MS. No, 175, the dedica-
tory epistle prefixed to the De
Templo is addressed to Not-
helm, not. as in Giles, to Acca.
So also in the Phillipps MS.
No. 9428. for a sight of which
I 11111 indebted to the courtesy
of Messis. Maggs brothers, into
whose possession it eame; and
in MS. Reg. 5. D. X.

⁵ This is not absolutely con-
clusive. The De Locis Sanctis
is omitted from that list. though
it is cited H. E. v. 17 adfin.
