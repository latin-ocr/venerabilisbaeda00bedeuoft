Bede in this connexion, and for him it means, not ‘the
outward and visible sign of an inward and spiritual g1·ace‚’
but rather the inner and spiritual meaning of an external
fact, or narrative, or name ¹. Had not St. Paul himself
declared that all things happened to Israel in a figure, and
were written for our admonition2‘? Did not our Lord

¹ ‘The word sacramentum in
early Christian writings has two
senses: (1ss It is the equivalent
of the Greek μυστήριον, . . . “ a
sacred ordinance, or doctrine,
or fact‚'' more especially where
a deeper verity is hidden under
some familiar externa] form. . ..
(2) It is used in its classical
sense of “a solemn obligation,
or pledge, or oath.'’ In both
senses it was applicable to the
two ordinances which we call
sacraments, . . . though in the
latter sense it was inore ap-
propriate to baptism? Ltft.,
App. Ff. ΙΙ. i. 51. It is in the
former sense that Bede most
commonly uses it ; and especially
in the plural 3 ‘altius sacramen-
tum fidei . . . continet numerus
ille militun1,' Opp. vii. 173;
‘cuius uectis si . . . sacramentum
scire desideras,’ ib. 301; viii.
244; ‘patet sacramentum,’ zze.
‘the inner meaning is plain,'
ix. 10. Bede is especially fond
of tracing the inner significance
of proper names: ‘Felix . .
iuxta sui nominis sacramentum?

Nola: ‘nominis sui mysterium
factis exequens,’ Opp. iv. 1763
