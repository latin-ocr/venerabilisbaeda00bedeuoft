ς 14.] Bede's Life (md W orlcs. lix
very near to throwing over the litera] sense entirely⁷ as
when he says that the Song of Songs ‘nil carnale et iuxta
literam resonet ¹.’

The allegorica] method has lost much of its credit.
To us it seems an arbitrary and subjective process
whereby anything may be made to mean anything,
according to the taste and fancy of the expositor. And
seeing that Bede expressly lays down that the interpreta-
tion may go by contraries, good meaning bad, and bad
g00d23 that the same persons and things may typify
different things at different times 3, and that the order of
events in the type and its fulfilment may be reversed ⁴3
it is obvious what scope is left for the play of the subjec-
tive imagination 3 and we can readily understand that, as
Bede says, a single line may contain matter for many
pages ⁵. But though seemingly arbitrary, the method has
its fixed laws and rules, ‘leges tropologiae ⁶‚' ‘leges alle-

goriae ⁷‚’ or ‘regulae allegoriae-‘³3'
