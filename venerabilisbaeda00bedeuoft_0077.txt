§15·] Becle's Life and Worlcs. lxiii

has been already said of Bede’s interest in the Paschal
question.

The difficulties of the Church vary from age to age, and
many of the controversies in Which Bede engaged with
such ardour seem pale and colourless to us. We have
lost also much of our zeal for orthodoxy as such. We
think that questions of practice are more important than
questions of doctrine. It remains, however, to be seen
whether we can, in the long run, maintain the super-
structure of Christian practice, when we have undermined
the basis of Christian doctrine on which it has been
reared.

But whatever t-he difficulties of our times may be, Bede
has a source of vconsolation for us. He remarks truly
that the different forins of error often mutually destroy
one another¹ ; and in a fine passage he shows how much
the Church has indirectly owed to the multifarious here-
sies by which she has been attacked. But for this, the
greatest works of Athanasius and Ambrose‚ Hilary and
Augustine would have remained unwritten2. It is the
law of antagonism‚ of the struggle for existence, of the
survival of the fittest applied to religious things ; the old

Heraclitean doctrine that opposition is salutary, that the
fairest harmony results from difference, and that all

things are evolved by way of st1·ife‘''. And we may be
sure that the outcome of our present difficulties, if we
only meet them faithfully and binvely, will but be to en-

 

large our view of and confirm our hold upon the truth.
