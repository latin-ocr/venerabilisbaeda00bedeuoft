«ΓΜ. ξ 16. Another point which may strike a modern reader

ἑξὲζὲξξᾟξ unfavourably in Bede’s historical works is the presence

Bede‘s of the miraculous element in them. Ι have already said ¹

work& that in the life of st. Cuthbert Bede shows a tendency to
emphasise this element beyond what his authorities
justify. It was natural to his age ², and especially
natural to his religious spirit to see direct interpositions
of the supernatura] everywhere.

The subject of mediaeval miracles is one of considerable
difficulty. The large majority of them may be set· aside
at once, as being quite deficient in anything like contem-
porary evidence. Many may be condemned summarily
on interna] evidence, being silly, unspiritual‚ or even posi-
tively immoral. Others are open to suspicion as being
so evidently modelled on the miracles of the Bible, and
still more on those of the apocryphal ὅθι-1111111553. Others
are merely classical myths, or widely diffused folk-tales
masquerading in 311 ecclesiastical dress ⁴. Others need
not necessarily be miracles at 311, but may be either mere
coincidences ⁵ brought about by perfectly natural means,

been divinely ordered ⁶ 3 or due to causes which are only

The subject is too intricate to be
gone into here, but would well
repay careful study. Of course
several of these grounds of sus-
