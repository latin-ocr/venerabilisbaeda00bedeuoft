Bede's Life cmcl Works.

lxxi

Against one form of religious folly,

which is ever with us, the folly, namely, which would
seek, in defiance of Christ’s express command, to fix the
day and the hour of His second coming, Bede is justly

severe ².

ξ 19. And now the time was coming when Bede was Bedes-
death,

to show forth in his own person, that which he had so
lovingly described in the case of others, the blessedness ot'
a holy death. Already when he wrote the letter to Arch-
bishop Egbert in Nov. 734, he was ill, and unable to
keep his engagement with tzhe Archbishop. And the end
was not very long in coming. There are difficulties as to
the year of Bede’s death ; the traditional date is 7 3 5, and

Ι 3111 disposed to adhere toit ³.

¹ Opp. x. 373 cf. xii. 58.

² Opp. xi. 2503 Vi· 332’·334·Α

Some tried to evade the force of
this command by saying that
though Christ had forbidden· us
to inquire ‘the day or the hour,’
he had not forbidden 115 to in-
quire the year. Opp. i. 151,
152. Of Bede’s views 011 vir-
ginity and marriage, which are
eminently sensible, and, with
one exception, scriptural, 1 have
spoken in the notes to H. E. i.
27. In regard to the relation of
the active to the contemplative
life, Bede 15 3150 free from
mediaeval exaggerations. See
the notes to H. E. ii. 1. Ι can-
not see that we have any reason
to pride ourselves on our superior
wisdom, because on these points
we have gone to the opposite
extreme from that into which
the Middle Ages fell.

³ Some foreign chronicles
place his death in 730. Pertz,
i. 1143 ii. 221, 239. More place
it in 731. Ib. i. 24, 25, 64, 67,

Of 1115 last hours we have

733 ii. 281 ; iii. 138 ;; iv. 6, 12;
xv. 187, 1294. This date is pro-
bably due to a confusion between
the date of Bede's death, and
the date of the completion of the
H. E. For the latter 731 is
correct. One chronic-le places
Bede’s death in 733 QPertz, vi.
26], but the indiction points to
731. Any date earlier than 734
15 inadmissible because of Ep.
ad Egb· ἐξ 13, 17, pp· 416- 423,
and notes. 734 is the date of
all MSS. of the Sax. Chron.‚ of
the Ann. Ult.‚ W. M. i. 58, G. P.
p. 385. RW. i. 220, and probably
of Ethelwerd and H. H. p. 115.
Fl. Wig., following the Chron.,
gives 734, but 1115 own criteria
pnint to 735. and he himself re-
gards this 35 the date indicated
in Cuthbert’s letter, i. 53. 735
is the date of Cont. Bed. infr.
p. 3613 of S. D. 1. 41, 224, 228 ;
and of the Ann. Lindisf„ Pertz,
xix. 505. Two foreign autho-
rities give 736, Pertz, iii. 1533
v. 13 and four give 737, ib. iii.
