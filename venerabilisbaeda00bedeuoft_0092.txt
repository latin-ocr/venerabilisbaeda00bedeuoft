moreover that many things could be narrated and written
concerning 111111, but my unlearned tongue makes my

words the briefer.

But I purpose with the help of God

to write at leisure more fully about him the things which
my eyes have seen, and my ears have heard ⁴²?

genuine, the intention was
either not carried 0111, or the
letter has perished.

³ ‘Senex 3111115 61 sapientia,

‘De eo loquamur, reminiscentes

and asks indignantly whether
Bede’s monastery could not pro-
duce anything better than this:

‘Presbyter 1110 Β6(13 requi-

As to 1116 fate of Bede's relies,
566 δ. D. i. 42, 88, 89, 168, 252,

253 (cf. ib. 221, where Bede is
spoken as ‘ breoma bocera‚'
‘ famous bookman'); R. W. i.
223; Stevenson, Church His-
torians, Ι. 11. pp. 111, xx, xxi. They
were translated to Durham in
the eleventh century, and placed
with those of St. Cuthbert, whom
he had so fervently admired.
Alberic of Trois Fontaines in his
chronicle at the year 1115 cites
the following from Helinandus z
‘uenerunt ad abbatiam .

que diciturVViltonia, ubi ostensa
est 615 sepultura uenerabilis
Bede.' He then continues in
his own person: ‘hic oritur
questio . . . quid sit uerius de
sepultura . . . Bede, uel 51
utrumque stare potest, et quod
hic dicitur, et quod in legenda
translationis beati Cuthberti . . .
scribitur. Sed dicunt quidam
quod fuerunt duo Bede, primus,

wiltonia? Pertz, xxiii. 820.
Τ116 last sentence is interesting
35 showing that Alberic knew
Bede chiefly by his homilies,
v. s, pp. xlvii, xlviii. For other
persons of the name of Bede cf.
