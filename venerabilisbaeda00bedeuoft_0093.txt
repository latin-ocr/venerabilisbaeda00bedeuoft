never, thank God. been deficient, and of which we have
seen in our own day bright examples in the person of
men like Richard William Church and Henry Par-ry
Liddon.

The world has in many ways made great progress since
the days of Bede. If he could come to life to-day‚ he
would find indeed part of his beloved Church at J arrow
still standing¹3 but the-monastic buildings are almost
wholly gone, and the face of the country has been utterly
transformed. Instead of the small and scattered villages
of Bede’s time ²³, he would find a. dense mining and 11131111·
facturing population ; the then quiet reaches of the lower
Tyne resound with the din of shipbuilding, and the 1031·

With the smoke of colliery and furnace. How far all these
things have really added to the happiness of the world,
may, Ι think, be doubted. But even rating them at the
very highest value that has ever been put upon them by
the most zealous votaiy of material progress, we have not,
it seems to me, amid 311 our discoveries, invented as yet
anything better than the Christian life which Bede lived,
and the Christian death which he died.
