Phillipps MSS. once (p. 231), the Bai-low MS. (= 010),
though not mentioned in the preface, is once cited
(p. 148), a citation which is borrowed from Smith (p. 78),
and MS. Colbert is cited at p. 171, also from Smith
(p. 100).

Moberly (1869, reprinted 1881) says: ‘The text of the
Chul-ch History is that of 81111111 corrected in a few
places by that of M. H. B.’ (p. xix).

Holder in his handy editions of the text used no fresh
MS. material, though he utilised the work of pre-
vious editors, including Lumby and Mayor; and he
introduced a theoretieal orthography based on Bede's
treatise De Orthographia, which is not that of any of
the MSS, and is 1101 consistently carried 0111 ¹.
