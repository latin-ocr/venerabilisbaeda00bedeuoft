Latin orthography Ι have neither normalised it; nor
have Ι reproduced that of M, which is in many respects
highly individual¹ ; but Ι have adopted that which had
in its favour the prevailing practice of the four MSS;
which may be taken to represent fairly the Latin ortho-
graphy of the eighth century, the century in which the
Hist. Eccl. was written ². (In the case of Bede’s Hist.
Abb. and the Hist. Anon. Abb., where one of the MSS.
(Hl) is so much earlier than all the rest ³, I have repro-
duced exactly the orthography of that MS.)

In addition to the four MSS. which have been collated
throughout, numerous MSS, especially in Oxford and
the British Museum, have been examined and collated
in certain test passages. The object of this examination
has been chiefly to investigate the relations of these
MSS. to the four primary MSS, and to one another,
for Ι have rarely felt justified in altering the text arrived
at by a comparison of the four oldest MSS, even when
apparently faulty, in deference to the readings of MSS.
of which the oldest is two centuries later; since it is
probable that these represent, not a better MS. tradition.
but merely the conjectures of later scribes. We have
a concrete illustration of this in the corrections made in
the text of M by the scribe of H,⁴. Nor have Ι intro-
duced into the text conjectures or corrections of my own.
Ι have relegated them, even when they seemed most
certain, to the pages of the Commentary.
