labour. Ι have, however, been able to arrive at some
results which are probable and not uninteresting. They
may at any rate serve as, starting-points for any who
wish to pursue the subject further. Readings from
these later MSS. which from this, or any other point of
view, seemed to be of interest, are occasionally given in
the critical notes. More will be found in the additional
critical notes at the end of vol. i. The Anglo-Saxon
version 15 also occasicnally cited.

ξ 22. The MSS. of the Hist. Eccl. are extremely
numerous. Hardy, in 1115 Ca'calogue, i. 433—441‚ enu-
merates 133 ¹, the highest figure reached by any work in
the first volume of that Catalogue, except Geoffrey of
Monmouth’s De Gestis Regum Britanniae, of which 172
MSS. are enumerated (ib. 341—348). The juxtaposition
15 interesting. For if Bede be the father of English
History, Geoffrey is no 1055 surely the father of mediaeval
romanoe.

The four oldest MSS. on which the text of the present
edition 15 based are the Moore MS. (M), Cambridge Univer-
sity Library, Kk. v. 16 3 Cotton, Tiber. A. xiv < B) 3 Cotton,
