lxxxviii Introduction. [PART 11.

been executed, I had not at that time collated the other
MSS„ and had not realised fully the worthlessness (for
textual purposes) of this MS. We need not go beyond
the preface and the first chapter of the first book to see
how ignorant the scribes were of Latin; thus: ‘prae-
scriptum for ‘presbyteruan p. 6, l. 153 ‘scriptare
padsnmsi' for ‘scripta repperi, adsumsi,' p. 7, l. 2 from
bott0m3 ‘unum ferunt' for ‘auium ferax,’ p. 10, l. 2;
‘pallerare' for ⁴ pallesce1·e‚’ ib. 14, &c Their ignorance
of history and geography is shown by the way in which
they have bungled over the word ‘Scotti'; thus: ‘ad-
rantos’ for ‘ad Scottos,' heading of i. 133 ‘rectorum '
and ‘sanctorum’ for ‘Scottorum’ p. 71, ll. 8, 22, &c.
The commonest contractions are mistaken3 ‘quam.'
‘quia’ and ‘quod' are constantly confused; so ‘pen'
‘prae' ‘pro‚' ‘post’ and ‘propter'; ‘con,' ‘cum‚⁵ and
⁴ contra' ; ‘tamen ' and ‘ tantum ’3 ‘sed ’ and ‘sicut ’ς
‘a’ and ‘aut'; ‘hoc’ and ‘autem'; ‘aut' and ‘ante';
(0Ῑο ’ (episcopo) and (ᾖ) ’ (ipso) p. 328, 1. 16. Omissions
are frequent ; the most important being in v. 12, and at
the end of v. 22. Sometimes the scribes could not read
their copy, and spaces were left which were only filled
up later⁷ or not at all. The MS. has been corrected
throughout by later hands. But the corrections are often
as bad as, sometimes worse than, the original text ¹.
Hence, except in the case of proper names² this MS. is
only sparingly cited. Nor need it be taken into account
in discussing the mutual relationships of the various
MSS„ for so far as I have discovered, no other MS.
