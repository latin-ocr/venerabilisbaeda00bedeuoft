xc Introduction. [Pam 11.

extract from St. Isidore on prohibited degrees, and the
decree of Gregory Π in the Roman Council of 721. The
latter is mutilated owing to a folio having been excised
at the. end. The MS. has been corrected throughout by
later hands, some of which at any rate are at least two
centuries later ¹.

Apart fron] the fact that the existence of other MSS.
of equa] weight precludes the idea of basing the text
solely on M, this MS. is not so uniformly correct as to be
above criticism. The notes give frequent testimony to
this fact ². The spelling is peculiar and arbitrary,
especially in the matter of double letters 3 thus we have
‘ accesit,’ ‘cesisse,' p. 20 ; ‘'misus,' p. 89 3 ‘iusit,’ p. 45 ;
‘decolatus,' p. 21, note 1 3 ‘positis ⁹ (for ‘possitis’), p. 44,
note 2 3 ‘anuo,' p. 111 ; ‘dificultass p. 14. On the other
hand ε ‘persuassio,' p. 53 ; ‘suassiQ’ p. 112 ; ‘ dis-
possuisse,’ p. 130; ‘misserant,' p. 137, note 3 ; ‘tollerare’
p. 83 3 ‘Cessare' for ‘Caesare' p. 122. WVords ending in
-iz', -ἰὶε, &c., are generally written with a single v2', but not
always; we get even such forms as ‘pissimo’ for ‘piis-
simos' p. 44, note 5 ; ἰ and e are in hopeless confusion, so
that the testimony of this MS. is practically worthless as
to whether we should read, aa. ‘suscipimus' or ‘sus-
cepimus,’ p. 2403 ‘accidere’ or ‘accedere’ pp. 59, 60.
This is the case in some degree with the other three
MSS, but not to the same extent. A further peculiarity
of this MS. is the way in which the scribe abbreviates
the scripture quotations in the text, giving the first few
words, and the last few words with the phrase ⁴ usque ad ’
between them, pp. 102, 121, 188, δια, or else adding
‘et cet? after the first words, pp. 58, note 1 ; 124, note 2.

¹ See above, p. lxxxiii. 3 and 6; septum for sceptrum,

² Thus: illum for ituri, p. 82, p. 212, note 53 quam for quia,
note 33 solemstiiialem for solstitia· p. 274, note 6; commemorandum
lem, p. 155. note 3 ; protracto for forcommoclwn, p. 277, note 93 de-

squacto, p. 169, note 2 ; orientales praecessori for praedecessori, p. 295,
for occidentales, pp. 194, 195, notes note 5, &Q
