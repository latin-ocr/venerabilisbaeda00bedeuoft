book at the beginning. and ends at the word ‘regnabat'

These losses are due to the great Cottonian’ fire of 1731,
in which this MS. suffered severely ¹. Owing to this fact
also the original size of the MS. and its gatherings cannot
be given3 and all evidence as to its history 1133 been
destroyed. This is the more to be regretted‚ as the MS.
is of great interest. The writing is of the same general
character as that of C, but more pointed ². The initials
of the chapters are illuminated. and larger illuminations
mark the beginnings of the books. Contractions are less
frequent than in M. It has been corrected all the way

before him. Many pages of the critical notes will supply

readings of C are clearly inferior to those of Β ⁴. It has

is not safe to argue from the

fact that Mr. XVarner⁷ of the

Museum, whose acquaintance
with Latin MSS. is unrivalled,
stated, when his attention was
called to this point⁷ that he did
not remember to have seen this
peculiarity in any other MS.
