xcii Introduction. [PART 11.

in many minute particulars which cannot be accidental:
‘loeti’ for ‘leti,’ p. 79, note 23 ‘ciuitas’ for ‘ciuitatis,'
p. 94, note 1 3 ‘eandem' for ‘eundem,' p. 100, note 2;
‘ob' for ‘ab,' p. 105, note 2 ; ‘misser-ant ⁹ for ‘miserant’
p. 137, note 3; ‘patefactum' for ‘patefactan1,’ p. 166,
note 43 ‘uincerant' for ‘uinxe1·ant,' p. 250, note 53
‘ sortibus' for ‘consortibus,' p. 294, note 13, ἃς. 011 1110
011101· hand, neither of these MSS. is derived from the
011101·; each has peculial-ities of its own, Β does not
abbreviate the quotations as (1005 Μ, and what is more
decisive, each has omissions which are not found in the
other. For omissions in M which are not found in B see
pp. 16, 11010 1; 68, note 33 92, note 23 124, note 63
129, 11010 4; 143, note 1 3 151, note 4, &c For omissions
in Β which are not 111 Μ (and these are more considerable)
see cg). pp. 169, 11010 5; 172, 11010 3, 275, note 3; v. 16,
17, and notes. Hence it follows that both MSS. must be
copied from a common original.

As soon as this fact 15 realised, it becomes plain that
we can no longer take M as the 5010 basis of our text.
Where M and Β agree we may presume that we have
1110 text of their common original; i. e. we have the
testimony not of two independent MSS. but really of
a single MS„ though a MS. more ancient than any which
we possess, and which cannot be very far removed from
an autograph of Bede. VVhere however M and Β differ,
we cannot straightway award the palm to M; We must
either decide by internal evidence, 01· we must call in
further external testimony. From this point of view
I attach very great importance to the agreement of either
M or Β with C. For C, as I shall show, contains a different
recension of the text from M and Β, and is therefore
a wholly independent witness. And it Will be found,
Ι think, that where M and Β differ, C more often agrees
with Β than with M ; in other words, where they differ
Β is 111010 often right than M. Hence B has at least an
