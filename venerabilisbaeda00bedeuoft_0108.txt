as an alternative. Yet Simeon of Durham, who embodies
this passage in his history, has ‘meditaturum’ (ii. 42).
Again, towards the end of the prefaee (p. 7, line 5 from
bottom) where Bede speaks ‘ de sanctissimo patre et
antistite Cndberchto,’ a later hand in C has inserted
the word ‘ nostro' after ‘patre'

ξ 27. The type of text which C exhibits is in several
important points very distinct from that found in M, B, N.
Ι call the former the C-text or type, the latter the M-text
or type.

Of the MSS. which I have been able to test a certain
number are of the M-type, rather more are of the C-type,
while the most numerous class shows a conflate text, the
basis being of the C-type, but- contaminated by insertions
and corrections of the M-type.

Apart from minuter (lifferences of reading, the more
important points in which the two types differ are these.

1. The clause in Which Bede asks for the prayers of
his readers, ‘Praeterea omnes . . . inueniam,’ p. 8, is
found at the end of the Preface in the M-text, but in the
C-text it is placed at the end of the work.

2. The chapter which is numbered iv. 14 in the
editions is omitted altogether in MSS. of a pure C-type ¹.

3. The words ‘cuins supra memininnls,’ near the
beginning of iv. 18, which do not as a matter of fact
correspond to anything in the preceding part of the work

¹ In M itself cc. 13, 14, 15 of
Book iv. form a single chapter.
In B thore is adivision between
ee. 13 and 14. and in Ν between
ce. 14 and 15. In A„ another
MS. of the M-type, the three
ehapters are divided from one
another, bnt in no MS. that
Ι have seen are there separate
headings in the capitula for
ce. 14 and 15. So that these

headings rest on no MS. autho-
rity. It is interesting to find
that W. M. had observed this
variation in the MSS. : ² Oswaldi
