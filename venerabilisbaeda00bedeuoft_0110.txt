xcvi Ι Introduction. [PART 11.

accordingly in HJ, which, as I shall show, is a derivative
of O„ this clause occurs in both places3 while iv. 14 and
the clause ‘cuius supra meminimus’ are inserted in the
text of 113¹. This is the most extreme case of conflation
that Ι have met with. The symbol V (uacat) indicates
that the MS. is defective at this point.

1t will be seen from the above table that the com-
monest and simplest form of conflation is the insertion
in a C-type MS. of the chap. iv. 14 from a M-type MS.

ξ 28. The question next arises which of these two
types of text we are to consider as the earlier.

From the test passages Nos. 1 and 5 no inference can
I think be drawn either way.

No. 2 at first sight favours the view that M is the later
type. It seems more natural for an author to add to his
work in later editions than to make excisions.

No. 3 points slightly the other way. In the first draft
of the work, Bede, who had written so much about
Benedict Biscop in his History of the Abbots, might
easily forget that up to that point he had not mentioned
him in the H. E. On a revision of the work this might
be detected and corrected.

occur in Ar, which, as Ι shall daughter MS. to H3.
