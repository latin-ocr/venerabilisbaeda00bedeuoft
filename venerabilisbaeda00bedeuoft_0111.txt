No. 4 seems to me decisive on the same side. Bede
finished the H. E. in 731 ¹. At that point the chrono-
logical summary in the M-text stops. The insertion in
the C-text of two later annals, 733 and 734, seems to
show that that recension was made in the latter year;
and as the death of Archbishop Tatwin is not mentioned
in that part 01 1116 7 34 3111131 which is embodied in the
C-text, it is probable that that recension was made before
July 3ο, 734, 1116 (1316 01 Tatwin’s death. Moreover the
facts that he was the ninth archbishop, and that his
accession coincided with the fifteenth year 01 Ethelbald
of Mercia would seem more important in 1116 year 01 1115
accession than three years later.

We seem 10 have an indication of a yet earlier re· Traee «η’ a
cension from which iv. 32 was absent, and in which the ᾗὲιὲὲξξᾚω

vwholly 01 mainly of the latest or C-recension that this

trace of the earliest recension has been preserved. With
this fact 15 110 doubt connected the variety in order and
reading which the MSS. 01 311 three classes exhibit in
the capitula 01 iv. 31, 32.
