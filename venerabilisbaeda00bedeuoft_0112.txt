The H. E. occupies ff. 8—1481). Of the matter which
occupies the remaining leaves 01 the MS. Ι will speak
presently. The gatherings are usually 01 eight, but also of
six and four. After f. 67 a fold probably of eight leaves has
been lost and the lacuna has been supplied by the inser·
tion 01 a fold 01 ten leaves of which the last has been
cancelled. The writing of this insertion is from 150 to
200 years later than the rest 01 the MS. In some cases,
aq. ff. 58, 59, 110, the writing is large and unnaturally
spaced3 in others, e. ῃ. ff. 85, 92, it is unnaturally con·
tracted. This looks as 11 the folds had not been written
consecutively, but the later sometimes before the earlier ;
so that the scribe had to cover a definite amount of
vellum to make them join. This MS. is unqzcestionablgs

vergent lines 01 evidence. (1) It abbreviates the scrip-
tural quotations of Bede as M does, and in precisely the
same way¹ 3 and 01 all the MSS. which 1 have examined
it is the only one besides M which does so abbreviate.
(2) It agrees with M in many 01 the latter’s most obvious
