8ιο. (3) But the most decisive evidence of copying is
given by those instances in which the scribe of H1 has
misinterpreted the reading of M. Thus, p. 253, Μ reads
‘ ad 'calcariam 'ciuitatem qz- (quae)‚' meaning that ⁶ calc.’
and ‘ciu.' are to be transposed. Hl perceives this, but
mistaking ‘q:.’ for the conjunction ‘que’ transposes it
3150, and reads ‘ciuitatemque calcariam,' which makes
nonsense. Again, in v. 24, annal 538: ‘eclipsis solis . . .
ab hora prima usque ad ‘tertiam' M accidentally omits
⁴ solis,' then adds it on the margin at the end of the line
with a mark of insertion after ‘eclipsis' Hl overlooks
this mark, and copying mechanically reads ε ‘eclipsis . . .
ab hora prima usque ad tertiam solis ²? (4) A further
proof of the connexion of the two MSS. is afforded by
the extracts which follow the H. E. These are identical
with those which occur at the end of M, as far as these
latter, which are mutilated, go; viz. Isidore on Con-
sanguinity, and the decree of Gregory II. And more than
this, theg] arc in tlte same leand. If any one will compare

with the facsimile of Η1 111 M. H. B. (plate xxvii), he
will be convinced of this. In other words, it was the
scribe of Η1 who made these additions to M 3. After the

3 certain number of slips and
omissions for which M is 1101 re-
sponsible ; per contra. he has cor-
rected, generally quite rightly,
a number of M’s mistakes. Ι

all may be accounted for in one

of these two ways. None of

source besides M.

3 It is very interesting to note
that this same additional matter
from Isidore and Gregory ΙΙ is
to be found in a MS. of Bede's
Hist. Eccl. 31 1301110, Biblio-
theca Bongarsiana, No. 49. See
