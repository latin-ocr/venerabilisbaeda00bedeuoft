decree of Gregory II come various extracts chiefly from
St. Jerome, ff. 14Sb—151 a. Then follow some glosses:
‘'runcina, ascia3 circino, quod rustice dicitur com-
passus,' &Q Then on f. 151b is a short Frankish chrono-
logy : ‘Ab incarnatione Domini usque ad transitum Sancti
Martini, anni ccccxliiii. Ab inc. D. usque ad baptisma
Francorum, anni . . ..Abhinc usque in presens, anni
cccxi. Ab inc. D. usque ad transitum Chlodouei, anni
dlvi. Ab inc. D. usque ad transitum Sancti Remigii,
anni dlxxvi. A transitu Remigii usque in presens, anni
cclxx <?>.’ Then follow five lines which are nearly ille-
gible, but which are not chronological. The dates seem
to be those of the Julian era, which precedes the Chris-
tian era by forty-five years, Thus the death of Clovis
which is here dated 556 took place 511 A. D. (556-511
z 45& St. Remigius died c. 530 <576-520 z 46). Clovis
was haptized 4963 496 ÷ 311=807‚ and this must be
the time at which this chronology was drawn up. But
this MS. is not earlier than the tenth century. There·
fore this chronology must be copied from an older MS.
Preceding the H. E. comes the ⁴ Sermo beati Augustini
de lapsu monachi et uiduae,’ followed by various extracts
from Cyprian. Ambrose, Jerome, Setini Alcuin, ἄνα,
ff. 4—7. The first three leaves conta-in fragments of an
eleventh century obituary¹ which have nothing to do with
the MS. On f. 3 a in a coarse hand is the entry: ⁴ uxor
defuncti Almarici ‘de Leues uilla‘ debet duos modios
tritici? This seems to show that though the original
home of the MS. was in France, it belonged at one time
to the Priory of Lewes.
