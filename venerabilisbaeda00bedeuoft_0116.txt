cii Introduction. [PART ΙΙ.

from Egbert to Henry ΙΙΙ, and occupies ff. 1 a-4 b, come
the capitula of all the five books of the H. E. con-
secutively, ff. 40—7b3 whereas in all other MSS. that
Ι have examined the capitula of each book immediately
precede that book. Fui-ther, at the end the beautiful
invocation ‘teque deprecor, bone Iesu . . . ante faciem

ι tuam,⁷ is omitted. This is not due to mutilation3 for

the H. E. ends on f. 101 a, and the remainder of ff. 101, 102
is occupied With other matter. In one or two points it
shows an affinity with N. Thus it omits the clause:
‘gratulabatur ille . . . gauisus est’ at the end of v. 22 ;
it agrees with N in the peculial· reading in v. 12, ‘postea
aute1n,’ 810. See p. 309, note 2. But as it has ποί the
lacuna which in N immediately precedes that passage,
it cannot be a transcript of N3 and the same is true of
other peculiarities of N which are not shared by Ru. But
apart from these points the text of the H. E. is dis-
located in the most extraordinary way ; and as the points
of dislocation occur, not merely in the middle of a column,
but as a rule in the middle of a line, the dislocation must
be due to the scribe having copied mechanically a MS.
in which the gatherings had been misbound, and one
gathering lost altogether. The text now occurs 111 the
following order. After the capitula (v. 3.) we have:

(1) Preface to i. 27, ending with ‘quia pro ueritate‚’
p. 51, 1. 15, ff. 7b to 200 = 13& ff. of the MS. or 47 pages
of the present edition.

(2) iii. 9, beginning ‘Christianorum prorsus oboleri'
(sic), p. 145, 1. 5, to iv. 2, ending ‘erant inst1·ucti,' p. 204,
l. 5 from bottom, ff. 20 c to 370 z 17 ff. or 593 pages.

(3) 11. 1, beginning ‘aduenientibus nuper‚’ p. 79, l. 4
from bottom‚ to 11. 14, ending ‘esset consumata’ (sic),
p. 114,1. 14, ff. 37 c to 47 c: 10 ff. or 343 pages.
