however one point of interest. It is the only MS„ as
far as Ι am aware (besides two in the Phillipps collection
which I have not seen& which contains the chronological
continuation of Bede's epitome in v. 24. This con-
tinuation is embodied in that epitome; and I have
carefully collated it. But beyond this and the five test
passages I have not examined this MS ¹.

MSS. of the C-z‘gype.

ξ 30. C has been already described.
We come now to two groups of MSS„ which are closely
related to C, and also to one another. We may call these

OUSJS the Durham and the WVinchester group respectively3 at the

head of the former group stands the MS. belonging to the
Dean and Chapter of Durham, B. ii. 35 (D), at the head of
the latter the MS. belonging to the Dean and Chapter of
VVinchester, No. 3 (W). The chief point in which these
two groups agree with one another, and differ from C, is
the insertion of considerable additions in Bede’s chrono-
logical summary. (See the critical notes to v. 24.)
Further. both groups differ greatly from C, and from all
normal MSS. of whatever type, in the divisions between
the chapters 3 the divisions being very unskilfully made,
sometimes even in the middle of a sentence. But in
this matter of the divisions of chapters, the two groups
not only differ strongly from C, but also from one
another. Hence we must conclude that the original
MS. from which these two groups are ultimately derived
(i) was closely related to O; (ii) contained additional
matter in the chronological epitome; (iii) had the
divisions between the chapters marked very imperfectly
or not at all, so that later scribes, guided by the capitula,
had to make the divisions as best they could.

¹ Stevcnson calls it ‘a . . . . . . from a MS. of considerable
valuable copy, . . . transcribed authority,’ u. s. p. xxxiii.
