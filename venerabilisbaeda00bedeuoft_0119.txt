The fact that the inserted matter has mainly to do
With Wilfrid shows that the origin of this MS. must be
northern. The key to the position lies in an entry under
the year 667: ᾗ abb. scri. (noster abbas scripsit ⁵).
Who was the northern abbot about 667 whose writings
were so important as to deserve a special entry? The
answer to that question would fix the locality of the
parent MS. of these two groups. The evident interest in
Wilfrid suggests Hexham, Ripon, York, or possibly
Lindisfarne‘? Can it refer to the writing 'of the great
Lindisfarne Gospels by Eadfrid1? If so, the date is
probably placed too early.

Of the two groups, the D group is much nearer to C
than the W group. This is not surprising, seeing that
I have already given reasons for believing that C itself is
a Lindisfarne or Durham book. This greater nearness
of D to C is shown by the fairly numerous instances in
which they agree together against W. The following
may serve as speciinens : ‘ itaque,’ O, D, p. 42, note 4, ‘iam-
que,' W; ‘conue1·sione,' C, D, p. 106, note 3, ‘conuersa-
tione,' W; ‘cognoscuntur,’C, D, p. 84, note 3, ‘nosountur,’
W; ‘uocatur,' C, D, p. 253, note 9, ‘appellatur,' W;
‘uocatur,’ O, D, p. 286, note 7, ‘uocabatur,' W; ‘institu-
tionis,’ C, D, p. 332, note 3, ‘institutiS,’ W.

For this reason I take the Durham group first in order.

ξ 31. The parent MS. (D) belongs to the Durham The Dur-
Gathedral Library (B. ii. 35). The other members of the ham gr‘mp'
group are Harl. 4124 <H2); C.C.C.‚ Oxon. 279 (O„3);
Burney, 310 (Bu2) ; Additional, 2 5,014 <A5); Pemb.

D. This is a large folio MS. in double columns (Ι have The Dur-

The bulk of the MS. is of the twelfth century. But
a certain number of fifteentli·eentury traots are bound up
in it. This juxtaposition must, however, have taken
