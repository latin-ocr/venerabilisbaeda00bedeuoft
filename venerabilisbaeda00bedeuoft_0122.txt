eviii Introduction. [PART ΙΙ.

translation and continuation of Eusebius’ Ecclesiastieal
History in eleven books. The MS. is all in the hand of
one scribe whose name and date are given. f. 890:
‘Explicit liber hist. eccl. secundum Eusebium scriptus
per manum Guillelmi dicti Du Stiphel de Britannia, pro
uenerabili 61 religioso magistro Domino Vtredo Dunelm.
monacho, ao sancte sacre [εἰς Ieye: sacrosancte] pagine
doctore. Anno Domini millesimo 0000 octuagesimo
primo, uicesimo sexto die mensis Augusti G. Du Stiphel.’
And the same name occurs at the end of Bede's H. E..
f. 158 b. By ‘Britannia' is meant Brittany. This MS.
is the MS. marked N on pp. 56, 65 of Catalogi
Veteres Librorum Dunelm ¹. For another MS. by the
same scribe, see ib. 51, 192. The Utred in question
is Utred de Boldon‚ prior of Finehale, near Durham,
in 1116 second half of the fourteenth century (see Priory
of Fine-hale, pp. xxiii, xxvii, S.S. 1837).

Bu2 is known to be a transcripta of D, and its relations
need not therefore be discussed7 nor have I been at the
trouble to test its readings.

O„. This is a fifteenth-eentury MS.. small folio, double
columns, ff. 143. Its contents are given in Catalogi
MSS. Angliae 61 Hiberniae (1697), No. 20863 to which
should be added at the beginning ‘Regulae quaedam
a bonis uiris obseruandae.' On f. 7r0 is the name
‘Tha Allen ²⁷³ and on f. 671‘0 the entry ‘iste liber
pertinet George Huflss The Bede occupies ff. 72-137 10,
and is in a single hand, different from the rest of the MS.

'I'hat all these MSS. belong to the same family is shown
e by the numerous points in which they agree among them-
selves. and differ from all other MSS. which I have
examined. (i) Divisions of Chapters: thus i. 12 begins
‘Fracta est autem Roma’ instead of ‘Exin Britannia‚’

¹ This is proved by the fact ² On him see Macray, u. s. pp.
that the second folio begins, as 23-25.
there stated, ‘cibus ita refertur?
