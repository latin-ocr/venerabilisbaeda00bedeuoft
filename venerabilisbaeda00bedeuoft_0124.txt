cx Introduction. [PART ΙΙ.

26·20 ¹, ff. 108. ‘Late tenth cent. Written in minuscules
generally of a continental type, but obviously by English
scribes. . . . On f. 40 is a marked change of hand ex-
tending over three columns only, the characters being
strongly English in form, notably the ν and (J. The last
scribe, apparently beginning at f. 8 3 b, was the AEdelelm
who wrote the colophon. A monk of this name appears
in the “Liber Vitae '’ of Hyde Abbey (New Minster) early
in the eleventh cent. (ed. Birch, p. 138). . . . On f. 45 b, in
a hand of the fourteenth cent„ is a note on the transla-
tion of St. Birinus . . . from which it may be inferred
that the MS. was already at Winchester when the note
was written.’

The colophon referred to above runs thus: ‘Finit
Deo gratias ago. Quicumque legerit hunc librum uel
scrutanerit, ut det benedictionem pro anima AEdelelmo
(sic) qui scripsit hoc. Sit sic hoc hic in· aeternum.’
Then comes the following inscription in Irish: ‘escor
doont-erchinnach duillim; bennactl1(3ic,leqe: bennacht) en
scribenned ma beth 111 uarele beth ferr degenter 11ῖῖ 1191023

tioned by Hardy. The passages
in inverted commas arc from
a description of the MS. by
Mr. G. F. VVarner of the British

Rev. F. Madge, Librarian to the
Dean and Chapter of Winchester.
They are printed here by Mr.
VVarner's courteous permis-sion.

deed. It is evidently the work,

1 am mainly indebted to the
kindness of Dr. Norman Moore,
who tells me that the conjecture
‘ ni air’ for ‘nsi here' is due to
Mr. Standish Hayes O'Grady.
‘Is 0011 dond-erchinnach dul
lim; bennacht in scribennid;
ma beth ni uair ele bud ferr,
dogentar ni air.’ ‘It is fitting for
the erenach (or prior) to go with
me ; the benediction of the
writer ; ifthere be anything that
would be better at some other
time, something shall be done
forhim.'·—I am inclined to think
that the phrase ‘duillim' con-
tains the proper name ‘William ’
