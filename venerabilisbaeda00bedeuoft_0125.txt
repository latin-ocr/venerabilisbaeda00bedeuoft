‘After this⁷ still in AEdelehn’s hand, are twelve hexa-
meters beginning “Summe (for Sume) pater placidus
modulantis nota poete.” They form the preface to 3
poem addressed to Egbert, Bishop of Lindisfarne (803—
821) by AEthelwulf. . . ‚The verses end at the bottom
of the page, and no doubt the whole poeni followed on
leaves now missing. There is however reason to believe
that they are in the British Museum in MS. Cott. Tib. D.
iv. ff. 309—318. These leaves, which have nothing to do
with the rest of the MS. <Lives of Saints of the twelfth
cent.) with which they are bound up, contain the poeni
of AEthelwulf, without the prefatory lines, and beginning
at the top of the page. Allowing for the injury done to
thern by the fire of 1731, they are of the same dimensions
as the Winchester MS, and the hand . . . appears to be
identical with that of the lines in the latter volume.’

I cannot see that there is anything which throws light
on the history of the MS. Dr. Kitchin thought that it
had been originally a Glastonbury book ¹. Οἳ, as Ι shall
show presently, is a transcript of this MS„ though, owing
to the insertion in it of iv. 14⁷ I am obliged to place it 111
the class of conflate MSS. 3 but as regards origin, Ο2 and
derivatives of O2 <if any), must be reckoned as belonging
to the Winchester group.

The only other MS. which Ι can place here as exhibiting (Ιέιὸῑοι 170

that that inscription also may

would run t ‘There is due 1ο 1110

diction ' &c. In any case, if the
MS. came froin Glastonbury, the
Irish connexions of that monas-
tery receive an interesting il-
lustrati0n‚ as Dr. Moore remarks.

ancient asto enable us to identify

MS.

¹ For additional inforination
as to this MS„ I am indebted
to the Rev. F. Madge. In a
Glastonbury Catalogue of 1247,
we find ‘Historiae Anglorum
scriptae a Beda, bon. set uetust.’ ;
also, ‘ Beda de gestis Angloru1n.’
