cxii Introduction. [PART ΙΙ.

a pure C-text of the VVinchester type is Ballio] College‚
Oxford‚ No. 176 (019). This is a twelfth-century MS„
folio, double columns, 36·50>< 2570, ff. 182. The H. E.
occupies ff. 1-93‚ the remainder being assigned to Bede’s
Commentary on St. Mark. It is all in one hand, and
well written, the initials finely illuminated in green and
red. Owing to the glaze of the vellum or the thickness
of the ink the writing has peeled off in many places.

On a fiyleaf at the beginning is the entry: ‘Liber
domus de Balliolo in Oxon. ex dono Willm. Gray Eliensis
episcopi? William Gray was bishop of Ely, 1454—1478.
They are no other marks of ownership.

Apait from the general characteristics of the Winchester
group, O19 is specially connected with W by the adoption
in the text of the alternative beginning of v. 9 which W2
has written on the margin. The object of this alternative
was undoubtedly to make the passage more suitable for
reading aloud in church or in refectory¹3 and that the
scribe of O¹3 had this object specially in view is shown
by the fact that he has actually given to ii. 1 the heading :
‘Lectiones quedam de uita uel obitu beati Gregorii pape,
edite a uenerabili Beda presbitero.’ He would naturally
therefore prefer the alternative reading of W2 in v. 9.

The following are some of the points in which W, 02,
and O19 agree with one another against all other MSS.:
i. 8 begins (in the middle of a sentence) ‘ubi postea
redeunte,’ p. 21, 1. 27, instead of ‘at ubi turbo,' p. 223
ii. 2 begins ‘haec iuxta opinione1n,' p. 81, 1. 4, instead of
‘Interea Augustinus' in W and Οἳ, 111 Ο19 there is
a large initial to ‘ haec‚' but a still larger one to ‘interea.’
In iv. 1, p. 202, 1. 6, 1110 four oldest MSS. are divided
between ‘ Niridano’ and ‘Hiridano' as the name of

¹ The additional critical notes of MSS.5 notably in MSS. of the
will furnish many illustrations N. Τ. Cf. D. C. A. ii. 954. For
of this custom. It is a frequent the custom of reading aloud at
cause of corruptions of the text refection, ib. 987.
