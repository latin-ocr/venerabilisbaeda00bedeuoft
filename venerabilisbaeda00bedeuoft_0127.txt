Hadrian’s monastery; Ο2 and O¹9 both read ‘Oii·idano,“
and we may assume that this was the reading of W,
though the first letter has been tampered with, and is
now illegible. In iv. 25, p. 264, l. 17, where the M-text
reads ‘aspicerent’ and the C-text ‘conspicerent‚’ these
three MSS. read ‘suspicerent ¹.'

Of the corrections and alternatives written in W by
later hands some appear in the text 0102, others appear
in Ο2 also as corrections and alternatives by a later hand.

ξ 33. Other MSS. which exhibit a pure C-text without
any special affinities are the following :-——

Hatton 43 (0,), 4to, 26·25 >< 20·00‚ early eleventh cen- flamm 4,-
tury, ff. 177, of which the first eight are in a different (01³.
hand from the rest of the MS. On f. 129 a a somewhat
later hand has written the Anglo-Saxon version of Caed·
mon’s hymn <see notes to iv. 24). This is the MS. which
hythe corrections and additions of the later scribe has
prepared the way for the curiously conflate MSS„ Har
Ar, 07( τ. sup. pp. xcv, xcvi). Another feature of this
MS. is the addition by the later scribe of historic-al
glosses on the text. A leaf has been cut out between
ff. 66 and 67. At the foot of f. 152b is a verse of
a hymn to St. John the Evangelist. The MS. would
seem to have belonged to Glastonbury‚ if we may judge
from the fact that in the Preface‚ p. 7, ‘Laestingaeu’ has
been altered into ‘Glaestingaei.' (v. inf. p. cxxvii.)

Bodl. 712 (08). This is a fourteenth-century MS„ B‹J‹lle.v7¹-’
large folio, double columns, 34·00>< 22·50‚ ff. 371. It (0.)
contains, besides Bede’s H. E.. William of Mahnesbury's
