at the beginning: ‘omnium quos (Sic) uidi exemplarium
Bedae si artem spectes, hoc est iure praestantissimum.
This praise is excessive, but it is a fine MS. It has the
book-plates of Philip Carteret wem), and of Francis
Bonae, from whom it came to the Library. The latter
has inserted the note: ‘bought at Mr. Brander's sale,
pretium εΕΙ 13. od? It has a peculial· beginning to i. 7
which 1 have not noticed in any other Ms.: ‘regnante
in tempore illo Maximiano Herculio in Brittania passus
est sub eo eiusdem insulae Sanctus Albanus,’ Sco. This,
like many other corruptions in MSS„ is probably to be

I do not know whether it is

the Bishop's hand which has

word ‘papa’ or altered it to
‘episcopus’ A leaf is also
missing at the beginning of
Book iii.

So the scribe of Oll notes on

alio nomine Cadwaladrus in
Britonum historia nominatur.'
