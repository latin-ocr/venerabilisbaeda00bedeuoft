subject of early English history. It is a poor MS„ badly
written on very defective vellum.

These four MSS„ 013, He, 04, 010, exhibit the ordinary
C-text with the insertion of iv. 14, and are connected with
one another and with R1 by the fact that in the middle
of the inserted chapter they apparently make a division
marked by an illuminated capital at the words ‘Praeclari
omnino habitus‚’ p. 2 35, 1. 14. This can hardly be
accidental, and seems to point to some common source.

Moreover 01Ο is unquestionably a transcript of 01.
This is shown by the fact that they both have a special
heading to the hymn in iv. 20, which Ι have observed in
no other MS. : ‘hymnus in honore praefatae uirginis
elegiaco et paracberico [paracta-1001 010] uel reciproco
carmine compositus’ ; while both read ‘oriende ' for
⁴ oltandi‚’ i. 27, p. 58, l. 29 ; and ‘Augustarum ⁹ for
‘ Iuliarum‚' i. 30, p. 66, l. 5.

has been cruelly cropped by the binder. Fragments of

the full-sized margin which happened to have writing on
them have in some cases been preserved, showing that
nearly three centimetres have been cut away. On f. 1 ΓΟ,
top margin, is written ‘Jacobi Armachani’; vi. e. it be-
longed at one time to the admirably learned Ussher.
On the bottom margin is the entry: ‘Liber Gulielmi
Laud Archiepiscopi Cantuar. et Cancellarii Uniuersitatis
Oxou. 16 33.’ On the flyleaf a seventeent-h-century hand
(not Ussher's) has made the remark: ⁶ This is an exceed-
ing good copye‚’ and on the whole the praise is well
deserved. A leaf has been cut away at the beginning,
and another at the end 3 thus the Preface is lost, and all
after the words : ‘teque deprecor, bone Iesu ’ at the end.
Hence in regard to the first and most decisive test this
MS. is dumb. But 111 other respects it presents in
