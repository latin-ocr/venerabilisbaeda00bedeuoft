de Greco in Latinum transtulit uel composuit ζ’ ff. 24 5 a-
248 b, a pedigree of the Counts of Flanders from Hssdric
(Liderik) to Baldwin VII3 a list of kings of the Franks
from Clovis to Louis VI, ff. 248 b-249 a; three lections
from Bede on St. oswald, f. 249b3 some Anglo-Saxon
Glosses‚ f. 250 a ; the beginning of a homily for St. John
Baptist’s Day, f. 25010, and f. 251 a an interesting list of
books² ; a catalogue probably of part of the libr-ary of the
monastery to which this MS. belonged. This was ap-
parently Peterborough. On f. 250 ΥΟ appears the entry z
‘Anno Domini obiit frater . . . de burgo S. Petri’; on
f. 249 v0 the name of ‘Humffridus Natures.' This is
probably the person who is known to have been a monk
of Peterborough in 1534, Rector of Paston 1548—1553,
and the recipient of a pension as of Peterborough in
1553 ³.' On the top of the next page appears the name of
‘Henricus St01·kes,’ of whom Ι know nothing. At one
time the MS. must have been in the possession of some
zealous protestant‚ as the words ‘papa‚’ ‘apostolicus7’ ἂρ,
are constantly erased. With the exception of the inser—
tion of iv. 14 it is a MS. of the C-type. And the insertion
betrays itself as such3 for above iv. 14 is rubricated
‘alia' 3 above iv. 15, ‘item ’ ; and above iv. 16 ‘capitulum
quintumdecimum,’ though elsewhere this MS. has no
numbers to the chapters either in the text or in the
capitula.

¹ A book with exactly the
same title occurs among the

liche Bibliotheken, No. 515. A
person of the same name, also

Cambridge University MSS.:
see the Catalogue‚ iv. 357*.

2 Printed in Neues Archiv der
Gesellschaft fiir altere deutsche
Gesch. ii. 433 (1876). Gottlieb,
u. i.‚ who places it among ‘un-
bestimmte Verzeichnisse.’

³ Ι owe the information given
above to Mr. Madan; who also
refers to Gottlieb’s Mittelalter-

3 monk of Peterborough, ,for—
merly owned MS. Gough Missal
No. 47; cf. Maeray, Annals.
&c., p. 447. But from the
handwriting of the enti-y,
he must have lived at an
earlier time. Probably the
family of Natures was resident
in the neighbourhood of the
monastery.
