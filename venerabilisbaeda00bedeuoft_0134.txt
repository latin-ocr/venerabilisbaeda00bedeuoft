cxx Introduction. [PAR-r ΙΙ.

With this exception the MS. is, as I have shown
above (pp. cxi—cxiii), a transcript of W.

Stowe 104 [old number 863]‚ quarm, 25·75 >< 17-65.
ff. 149, twelfth century. It is mutilated at the beginning,
wanting the Preface and the Capitula to Book i ; but the
clause ‘Propterea (sic) omnes . . . inueniam ’ occurs at the
end ; and in other respects it exhibits the C-text with the
addition of iv. 14, and the insertion (above the line) of
the words ‘ cuius supra meminimus ' in iv. 18. At v. 2,
p. 284, l. 10, the scribe has omitted all after the words
‘syllabas ac uerba ’ to the end of v. 5, p. 289. The H. E.
ends on f. 112 a, and is followed by the letter on the
death of Bede ; then after some verses on the Arch-
];›ishops of Canterbury ¹ from Augustine to Iaenbert.
ff. 113 b-114a‚ comes the omitted portion of the H. E..
ff. 1 14 3-1 15 b, followed by some sections from Folcard’s
life of st. John of Beverley, ff. 1 15b-1 17a 3 then Ailred’s
life of Edward the Confessor, ff. 118 a—149 a ; f. 149 b is
occupied with the beginning of Hugo [2³ de S. Victore].
De uirginitate Sancte Marie. The special interest in
St. John of Beverley suggests a northern origin for this
MS. ‚ but beyond that I can say nothing. The word ‘ papa'
is frequently erased.

f. 1 30 1·0‚with the words ‘superadicere curaui‚’ v. 24, p. 357,
1. 9 from bottom, omitting the list of Bede’s works and
all that follows. Hence the clause ‘Praeterea omnes . . .
inueniam' does not occur in this MS. at all. It is pos-
sible that the scribe had an incomplete copy of the type of
the three next MSS„ and thought it better to conclude here
than in the middle of a sentence. The H. E. is followed
