cxxii Introduction. [PART 11 .

Τ116 name of another possessor of it seems to occur:
‘Sam. Coluile, scotus? This Charles Fairfax was
a son of the first Lord Fairfax, brother of the second,
and' uncle of 1116 third, the famous parliamentary
general. He was a barrister by profession, but in the
civil war he became a 00101161 of f00t3 like his more
famous nephew he joined with Monk in the restoration
of Charles II. He died in 1673 (Fairfax Correspon-
(161106, 1. lviii, f.). Some elegiae verses addressed to
him are on the flyleaf of the MS. It was by 1116 be-
quest of his nephew, the great Lord Fastfax, that this
and other MSS. came to the Bodleian. It contains,
besides the H. E„ Cuthbert’s letter on the death of Bede,
and Abbo of Fleury’s Passion of St. Edmund (imperfect)
prefaced by Abbo’s well-known letter to Dunstan. Two
marginal notes on iii. 27 and iii. 28 show the interest- of
the Selby scribe in the ecelesiastica] history of neighbour-
ing districts: ‘nota quod Lindissi insula proprium
habuerit episcopum ;' ‘nota quod Hripensis ecclesia pro-
prium habuerit episcopum.' The word ‘ papa’ has been
occasionally erased. It is a poor and uninteresting MS.
Lincoln College, Oxford, 31 (014), small folio, double

' Ι 00111111116, 26·25><17·50‚ ff. 201, twelfth or thirteenth

century. A poor and carelessly written MS. It contains,
besides theH. E„ 1116 161161 011 1116 death of Bede, and Bede's
Commentary on the Catholio Epissses, the last being in
a different hand. It is mutilated at the beginning.

Of these three MSS.. 020 and 0., are C-texts with the
insertion of iv. 14. O14 has further the insertion of
‘cuius supra meminimus’ 111 iv. 18. But in all three
the H. E. in the first hand ends abruptly with the words ε
‘ Martyrologium de nataliciis‚’ v. 24, p. 259, l. 15. This
is not due to mutilation, as in all three MSS. Cuthbert's
letter follows immediately, and the agreement cannot be
accidental. All three MSS. must therefore be ultimately
derived from some MS. in which a leaf had been lost
