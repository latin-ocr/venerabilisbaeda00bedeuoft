before Cuthbert’s letter, containing the last paragraphs of
the H. E. In Ο14 the want was discovered. and the
missing paragraphs added affer the letter, including the
clause ‘propterea (sic) omnes. . . inueniam.' But as it
is mutilated at the beginning we cannot be sure that that
clause may not have occurred also in the prefirce, as in
Η3 and Ar. This group shows a certain affinity with the
text of O„ but it is not directly derived from it.
§35 The next group of MSS.. A„ Οὓ, ΟΠ, ΟΠ, 015,F111-t11m·
Ο17 (to which may be added OM, which for special reasons ἓῗξὲζέἰοῃ
has been already described), show a further degree of
ι conflation of the C-text 3 they not only insert iv. 14, but
have the words ‘cuius supra meminimus' in the text of
· iv. 18. Moreover, with the exception of A.2⁷ they all
i show more or less affinity to O„ though Ι cannot say
h that any one of them is an immediate copy of that MS.
Within the group Oll is closely related to, though not
a transcript of ΟΠ. As Α2 stands apart from the other
members of the group Ι take it first.

AdditionaL 14‚250 (A), small folio, 2730 >< 17-00‚ Additional,

ff. 150, thirteenth century. It was purchased for the ¹⁴¹²5⁰(A²)'
Museum at the sale of Dean Milles' libi-ary, April 15,
1843, f. 1 VO, and on the top margin of f. 31²³ is the entry :
‘Liber domus Plymptonss On f. 2v0 is a pedigree of
Noah’s descendants. The H. E. occupies ff. 3 1-0—148 ΓΟ,
the remaining ff. (148 V0—150v0) being taken up with
a short chronology from the Incarnation to 1177, though
the last entry is 1170, ‘Anglorum primas corruit ense
Thomas’ It agrees with Od in a remarkable reading in
i. 27, p. 52, l. 10, the insertion of ‘ ordinantur alii episcopi '
after ‘episcopi‚' but it is not a transcript of 03, for in v. 2 1 ‚
p. 344, note 5, Ο3 has supplied an omission of the C-text
in its own way, whereas A2 has the correct reading ¹.

² The fact that this MS. uses Mr. Bradshaw's theory, Col-
‘finit’ and ‘ explicit' indiscri- lected Papers, p. 459, that ‘finit '
minately at the endof the books as opposed to ‘explicit’ is a.
of the H. E. is rather against· specially Celtic use.
