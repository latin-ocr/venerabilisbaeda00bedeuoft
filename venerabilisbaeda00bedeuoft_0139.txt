both read ‘huic ⁹ for ‘hicss O17 has ‘uel grandine ⁹ written
above ‘gramine,’ While Ο11 reverses them, putting ‘ gran-
dine’ in the text and ‘gramine ' above. These variants
Ι have noticed in no other MSS. In v. 1, p. 282, 1. 3,
O1⁷ has over the word ‘undiqueuersum’ the gloss ι1. ex
omni parte.' Oll writes in the text, ‘undique ex omni parte
uersum.' This might look like actual copying3 but· at
p. 182, 1. 19, Ο11 has the reading ‘de obseruantia one
paschae,'evidently copied from 3 MS. which had ‘obser-
uantia ⁹ in the text with ‘one,' i. e. ‘ obseruatione,’ written
as an alternative above. But this MS. is not ΟΠ, which
has the ordinary reading ‘ de obseruatione paschae ¹.'

lated at the end, all after v. 20 being lost 3 and from the (015)-
table of contents a good deal has been lost besides the
conclusion of the H. E. The clause ‘Praeterea omnes'
does not occur in the preface, we may therefore assume
that it was placed at the end; unless indeed, as with
Bul, it occurred in neither place. But this is unlikely.
After the word ‘studuinms,⁷ with which the preface in
the O-text ends, this MS. has the unintelligible addition,
peculiar to itself: ‘tempore pro Domino sanctum est
fuderunt.' The MS. came to the College ‘ex legato . . .
Roberti Ketrinham, quondam Rectoris ecclesie Sancti
Gregorii Lundon. Oretis igitur pro eodem, et bene-
factoribus eiusdem, omnium ac fidelium animabus 3
purgatorio liberandis.’ There are no other marks of
ownership.

letter on Bede’s death. On f. 1 is the name ‘W. Cant‚'
probably the same who gave O5 to Colonel Fairfax.

¹ A note on Aldhelm at v. 17 suggests Malmesbury as the pos-
sible home of ΟΠ.
