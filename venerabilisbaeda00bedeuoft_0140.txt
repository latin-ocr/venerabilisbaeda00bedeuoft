cxxvi Introduction. [Pam 11.

Final stage ξ 36. We come now to the most highly conflate group

pifoffpnfla- of all. Ι have shown above (pp. xcv, xcvi), how the
additions of the second scribe in Ol prepared the way
for this final stage, in which, in addition to other inser-
tions, the paragraph ‘Praeterea omnes ' is found both at
the beginning and end of 1110 work.

Harley3680 Harley 3680 (Hg), twelfth or thirteenth century, folio,

(H³')' 31·00><20·50, ff. 177. On f. 1 r0 is the entry, ‘Liber
Sancti Andree Roffensis Ecclesie,' and on f. 2 r0, ‘Liber
de claustro Roffensi Huberti precentoris 1.' And this
connexion with Rochester is further illustrated by the
fact that 011 1110 margin of ii. 9 15 written in a later
hand, ‘Legenda S. Paulini patris nostris The H. E. ends

death of Bede, ff. 173 v0—175 VO. Then comes an account
of the conversion of Kent, ff. 176 r0-177 r0 ; then ‘Nota-
tiones de Sanctis qui in Anglica patria requiescunt,’
f. 177V0, where it concludes, mutilated.

margin, ‘ Soc. Reg. Lond. ex dono Henr. Howard Nor-
folciensis‘2.’ This MS. 15 0111101· a transcript of H3 or
they are both copied from the same original. In addition
to 1110 mode of confiation and special readings in Which
they agree, Ar. has the same additional matter as Η3,
only, unlike H3, it is unmutilated. The ‘Notationes de
Sanctis' are complete, and are followed by ‘Beda super
fortem mulierem ³, ⁷ so that possibly Hs also contained this.
