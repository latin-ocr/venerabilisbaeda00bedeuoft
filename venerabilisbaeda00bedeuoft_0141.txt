ς 36·] The M cwzuscri pts. cxxvii

H3, is that in the letter on the death of Bede Η3 omits the

AngldSaxon verses, leaving a blank space of three lines

for them, whereas Ar. gives them, though in such a form

as shows that the scribe did not understand them. If

then Ar. was copied from ΗΒ, the scribe must have got

the verses from some other source. And this is not

impossible3 but the other explanation is simpler and

more probable. Ar. is a very ornamenta] MS„ adorned

with coats of arms, δια] But it is very carelessly written.

ning and end; and the table of contents shows that

a. good deal has been lost besides the connnencement

and conclusion of Bede's H. E. Owing to this fact

tests 4 and 5 cannot be applied ; but there cannot be

the slightest doubt that it belongs here. The following

instances will show conclusively the close connexion of

these three MSS. with O1 and with one another. In

ii. 2, l. 3, above ‘ proximae ³ 01² has written as an alterna-

The first are the arms of De-

1370-1406, to whom the MS.
most likely belonged. See Pap-

claim for Glastonbury a con-

Glastonbury could have nothing
