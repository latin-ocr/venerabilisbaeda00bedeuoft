cxxviii Introduction. [Pim- ΙΙ.
bernensionem ’ [-bor- An] for ‘doruuentionem.’ But the
two most decisive cases are the following. In iii. 25,
p. 186, ll. 6—7, in the phrase ‘a 111111ᾗ luna primi mensis
[ad uesperam usque ad XXI-‘¹111 lunam eiusdem mensis] ad
uesperam,’ 01 has by homoioteleuton omitted the words
in brackets. Ol2 has inserted on the margin ‘usque
ad . . . mensis.³ Thus one ‘ ad uesperam ’ is lost. And
this defective reading is the reading of the text of O„
Hg, Ar. In v. 7, p. 294, 1. 2, 01 reads ‘an. et cons, 1111.'
0,2 has on the margin expanded cons. (rightly) into ‘con-
sulatus‚' adding ‘sui'3 but 0,, Hm Ar. have all the im-
possible expansions of the contractions ⁶ ante et constantio
quarto.' I have said above that the table of contents of
O7 shows that the volume originally contained more than
the H. E. This is the table: ‘Historia Anglorum . . .
Bede . . . ; item epilogium de obitu eiusdem; et de
locis sepulture nonnullorum sanctorum Anglie’; i. e.
the additional matter in 07 was largely identical With
that in Ha and Ar. Ι have little doubt therefore that
0,, Η3, and Ar. were all copied from a common original,
which was itself derived mediately 01· immediately
from 01¹.

remarkable 15 that it is cited,
and a quotation made from it,
by Rudborne, Ang. Sao. i. 183.
He seems to think that Bede
himself wrote the Saxon version ε
‘liber quem composuit in lingua.
