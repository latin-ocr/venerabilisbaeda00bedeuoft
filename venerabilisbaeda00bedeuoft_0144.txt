cxxx Introduction. [PART ΙΙ.

4 and 5 cannot be applied: in other respects it seems
to be taken from a MS. of the M-type. About the same
time Eggesteyn printed an edition of the Latin version of
Eusebius. Both these were repr-inted at Strasburg in
a single volume in 1500. The Bede reproduces all the
features of the editio princeps3 and this is the case also
wsth the reprint of the same two works by Heinrich
Gran, Η38011311, 1506. In 1550 a separate edition of
Bede's HE. was published at Antwerp by John Grauius¹.
This not only contains the whole of v. 24, but the
continuation of Bede's Chronology is given continuously
with 11, preceding the list of Bede’s works. The preface
ends w 1111 ‘studuimus². ⁵ The work ends: ‘Te deprecor
. faciem tuam, qui uiuis et 1081133 etc. Α1110113.

Then comes Bede's epitaph, and the date of his death;

and then ‘Beda ad lectorem. Omnes . . . inueniam.

Vale ‘s But Ι 3111 inclined to think that this arrange-
ment is due to the editor. In most of the test points
this edition follows 1110 M-text. These features are
reproduced in the collected Basle edition of Bede’s works‚
1563⁷ except that the clause ‘Beda ad lectorem . . . Vale ’
is printed (111 3 different type) at the end of the preface.
All these editions are in folio. Octavo editions of the
H.E. appeared at Louvain in 1566, and in 1566-7.
ln 1583 it was embodied in the Hist. Christ. ueterum
patrum by Rene de 13 Barre, Paris; and in 1587 in
Commelin’s Rerum Britannicarum Scriptores, Heidel-
berg. This last seems to have been taken from 3 good
MS. of the M-type⁵. The continuation is printed con-
tinuously, but distinguished by different type. In 1601
there was an 8νο 0(1111011 of the H. E. at Cologne⁷ and in
1612 appeared the Cologne reprint of the Basle edition of
