Bede's collected works, which was itself reprinted 1688.
In 1681 Chifflet the J esuit published his edition of
Bede’s H. E. under the title ‘Bedae Presbyteri et Frede-
garii scholastici concordia,’ 4to, Paris. For this he used
‘S. Maximini Treuerensis codex peruetustus¹‚’ a MS.
which Hardy² identifies with MS. Phillips, 1873, and
believes to be a transcript of M. Certainly Chifflet's text
is of the M-type. At the end of the work, after ‘faciem
tuam,' Chifflet gives from the printed editions the
continuation of Bede's Chronology. This he believes
to be mainly the work of Bede himself, whose death he
places in 762 (1). In addition to these continental editions,
Giles³ mentions an edition of the H. E. at Lyons in 1587,
and collected editions of Bede’s works at Paris in 1544
and 1554. Hardy 4 further gives the following editions :
1483, Strasburg; 1493, Spires3 1514, Strasburg; 1545,
Paris; 1661, Cologne5.

In 1643-4 Abraham Whelock published, at Cambridge,
the first English edition of the Latin text of the H. E„
and the editio princeps of the Anglo-Saxon version. He
probably took his Latin text mainly from one of the
continental editions, but he used also three MSS„ one
belonging to Sir Robert Cotton, one to Dr. VVard of
Sidney Sussex College, and one to Trinity College,
Cambridge ⁶. In 1722 appeared Smith’s edition, already
described, which at once superseded all others.

Of translations into English other than the Anglo— Trans-

Saxon version, the earliest is by Thomas Stapleton,}}1{¹g‘'1¹i¹gl,¹¹³t'

⁵ The edition which Hardy
puts first: ‘No imprint, but
probably by Conrad Fyner at
Eslington, 1471 >< 1475,' is most
likely nothing more than a
wrong description of the same

edition as that which he gives,
more correctly, as ‘Strasburg,
1473. Hen. Eggesteyn.’
