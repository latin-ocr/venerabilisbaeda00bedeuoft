Antwerp‚ 1565, 4to (second edition, St. Omer, 1622,
8vo). The object 01 Stapleton was to influence Elizabeth
against the Reformation⁷ and to show the difference
between ‘ the pretended reformers ' and the early Church
of Augustine and his companions.

Another translation was published by John Stevens in
1723 ¹, and a third by W. Hui-st in 1814. Dr. Giles pub-
lished a revised version of Stevens' translation separately
in 1840, and in his collected edition of Bede’s Works‚
1843 2. A new and improved translation was given by
Mr. Gidley in 1870.

works of Bede, with the exception 01 1110 Metrical Life of
