lives of saints, of which the three first articles concern
us here. (a) Bede’s homily on Benedict Biscop, partly
printed from this MS. by Stevenson, Opp. Min. pp. 3 35-3. 38
(cf. Opp. v. 179—185, a different text). (b) Bede’s blstory
of the Abbots‚ ff. 7a-21 a. (e) The anonymous history of
the Abbots, ff. 21 εει-34 a. This MS. furnishes by far the
oldest and best text of Bede’s Hist. Abb„ and it was
rightly made by Mr. Stevenson the basis of his edition
(Opp. Min. pp. 139—162). It is not mentioned by Hardy,
Cat. i. 413 ; though on the preceding page he had cited it
as the only authority for the anonymous history of the
Abbots. Unfortunately there are two considerable lacunae
in it; the first in ξ 18, from ‘qui a primis’ to ‘commen²
dato—'3 the second in ἕξ 20—21, from ‘et in loco' to
‘geminorum martyrum.' The fact that in the former
case the lacuna ceases in the middle of a word ‘ com·
mendatoriam ⁷ seems to show that these lacunae are due
not to ‘an oversight of the scribe’ (Stevenson, pp. 158,
160), but to some mutilation of the MS. which he had
before him. This MS. is on the whole very accurately
written. There are some mistakes in it, mostly mere slips,
which can be easily corrected, and which have in most in-
stances been corrected by the scribe of the next MS ².
