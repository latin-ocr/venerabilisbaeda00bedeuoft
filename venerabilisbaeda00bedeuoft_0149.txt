Bede’s Hist. Abb. as far as the end of ξ 14, appending to

it a homiletic doxology‘2. For the second he took as his

basis the anonymous Hist. Abb„ which not only contains

particulars of Ceolfrid’s earlier life which are not in Bede,

but also by its homiletic exordium lent itself excellently

to the purpose of the scribe. To this also he appends

a doxology ³. He was not however content with this,

but interpolated the anonymous text from time to time

with passages taken from Bede’s Hist. Abb. He has not

always done his work very skilfully. In one instance he

introduces from Bede a passage practically identical

with one which had already occurred in the Hist.
