Cotton. Tiber. D. iii. <C)¹; folio, 26·50 >< 19-00, 111
double columns, of the twelfth century, ff. 249. It
was badly injured in the Cottonian fire. It also con-
tains lives of saints. The Hist. Abb. occupies ff. 1443.—
1491), and is preceded by the ‘Titulatio opusculorum
uenerabilis Bede presbyteri ab ipso edita‚' i. e. the
list of Bede's works taken from H. E. v. 24². I place '
this MS. first, though it is not the oldest MS. of the
group, because it has certain marked peculial-ities which
distinguish it from the other five members of the group,
and it is therefore convenient to treat it separately. Of
these peculial-ities the most interesting is that it alone of
all the MSS. has preserved the division of the work into
two books at the beginning of ἕ 14, which is certainly
original, as Bede himself mentions it in Η.Ε. v. 24 ³. In
ξ 18 there is an omission of nine words owing to homoio-
teleuton⁷ and the fact that this lacuna is not found in any
of the other MSS. shows that none of them can be copied
from this. The other peculiarities are unimportant‚
but they help to give this MS. a character of its own ⁴.

Christissand ends ‘intercessionis

it was taken from a copy of the
H. E. which had the clause
‘Praeterea omnes,’ &c.‚ at the
end of the work.
