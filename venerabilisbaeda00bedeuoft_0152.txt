cxxxviii Introduction. [Pam- 11.
Life of St. Outhberff, Bede’s metrica] and prose lives of
St. Cuthbert, and the work on the same saint by Reginald
of Coldingham or Durham23 lives of SS. Aidan, Eata ³,
and Ebba, and the Life of St. Godric by Geoffrey of
Durham 4. The MS. ‘is evidently the production of the
Durham Scriptorium⁵,' and the name of the scribe is

given on f. 1: ‘nomen scriptoris est Petrus Plenus
Amoris ⁶.’ Between the lives of SS. Ebba and Godric
come Bede’s Hist. Abb. ff. 174 a—179 a, and the life of
Bede. The text of the Hist. Abb. is identical with that
of D, and is, 1 believe, a transcript from it ⁷. This I
regard as proved by the fact that in ξ 17 it and P alone
keep the false reading of D : ‘iuxta euangelium regulam,'
which the other MSS. have amended either by omitting
‘ regulam' (O) or by altering ‘euangelium’ into ‘euan-
gelii ⁵ (B), thus restoring the reading of Hl. The text of
these six MSS. may be called the D-text.

The Hist. Abb. was first printed by Sir James Ware,
Dublin, 1664, Svo; reprinted by Wharton, London, 4t0,
1693. The MS. used by Ware was O. This is proved
by the fact that his edition reproduces the two salient

peculiarities of C, the division into two books, and the

lacuna in ξ 18.

It reproduces also most of the minor

peculiarities of C, a few obvious mistakes being corrected ⁸.
