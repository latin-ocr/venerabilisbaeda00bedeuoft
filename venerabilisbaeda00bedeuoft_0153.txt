Moreover that these corrections were made by VVare out
of his own head without recourse to other MSS. is shown
by the fact that in two instances his corrections do not
agree with any MS}

Smith (1722) collated VVare's text wlth D, P, and a MS.
which he calls ‘Merton,’ but which was probably, as
Hussey (Praef. p. v) suggests, Fairfax, no MS. of the
Hist. Abb. existing in the Merton Library. Hence
Smith’s edition exhibits all the features of the D-text.

Stevenson (1841) was the first editor to base his text
on Hv and it is consequently a great improvement on
that of his predecessors.

Hussey (1 846) practically reprinted Smith's text, though
he used Stevenson’s edition, and also Digby 112 for the
notes. His text is a retrograde step as compared with
that of Stevenson.

Moberly (1869 and 1881) reprinted Smith's text, 001-
lating it with Fairfax, from which he wrongly asserts
that Smith's text is taken. ‘

Whether the difference between the H-text and the
D-text implies a double recension by Bede himself, like
that which I believe to have existed in the case of the
H. E„ is hard to say. On the whole Ι do not think the
