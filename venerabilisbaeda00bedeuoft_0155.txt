pered with¹. His emendations however are not always
happy ², and his alterations are sometimes needless ³, or
worse 4. He has left some blunders uncorrected⁵'‚ and
added a· good many of his own 6. Probably his attention

much more numerous than where he is simply transcribing
Bede's Hist. Abb.

The Hist. Anon. was first printed by Stevenson, 1841,
from H, but not very correctly or completely.

Giles( 1 84 3) reprinted Stevenson’s text, Opp. vi. 4 16-432.

The present edition is the first in which Digby 112
has been made use of.

D. MSS. or THE EPISTLE To EGBERT.

§42 Of this I have only succeeded in finding two Two MSS.

MSS.-Har1. 4688, 311(1 Mert. Con. Oxon. 49. The Harleian
former (H) is a small folio, 29·00 >< 18- 50, tenth century, 4688 (ffi'
ff. 98. It contains, besides the letter to Egbert, Bede’s
exposition of the Proverbs of Solomon, the latter occupy-
ing ff. 1-88 3, the former ff. 89 a—97 a. The last leaf,
f. 98, 15 110 part of the original MS. This was a Durham
book, as is shown by a slip inserted at the beginning with
the inscription ‘Liber Sancti Cuthberti ² in a hand of the
thirteenth century. It is further proved by entries in
the ‘ Catalogi ueteres librorum eccl. cath. Dunelm' <S.S.
1838), pp. 20, 96: ‘Beda super parabolas Salomonis,
11 foL—pieneior rediit.’ These last words are the
beginning of fol. 2a of this MS. At a later time it
belonged to Sir Thos. Tempest, Bart„ fol. 1 a.

The other MS. (M) is 3 5111311 quarto, 21·00>< 14·20> &gnome
