TO INTRODUCTION, PART I.

ΟΝ THE CHRoNoLOGY OF BEDE's WRITINGS.

691 >< 703. DE ARTE METRICA and DE SCHEMATIBUS ET
TRoP1s SACRAE SCRIPTURAE.

In the little address between these two works Bede

writes : ‘Haec tibi dulcissime fili, et conlezcita Cuthberte

. . excerpere curaui‚' showing that it was written while

Bede was a ‘ leuita,' i. e. a deacon ¹.

Opp. vi. 78.

²? 691 >< 703. DE ORTHOGRAPHIA.
This is undated, but it probably belongs to the same

period as the preceding 2.

¹ On the use of the term ‘Ie-
uita ’ for deaoon, see Opp. i. 63 ;
viii. 383, 384. Bede identifies the
Nethinim with sub-deacons‚ ib.
375,376‚ and the high priest with
an archbishop, ib. 451. We have
even ‘leuitissa‚' ‘deaconessff
Ltft. App. Ff. II. iii. 468 ; cf. ib.
1. ii. 123, 329. In Giles‘ Ed. the
‘De Arte Metrica ’ is headed
‘ad Wiybertzcm leuitam.’ What
the MS. authority for this is
I do not know. The only MSS.
that I have seen (S. John’s Coll.
Oxon, No. 150, Digby 100) have
no heading3 in the address at
the end they read: ‘ conleuita
Cuthberte ’ (Carbeffe, St. J ohn’s).
Cuthbert may be the author of
the letter on Bede’s death. If

SO‚ the suggestion that he was
only a. ‘lector' at that time
(above, p. lxxii) must be given
up. There was a wigberte who
became abbot of Lindisfarne,
Opp. Min. p. 43 ; and he is prob-
ably the abbot &Vigbert who is
mentioned in the Liber Vitae
Eccl. Dun. Both MSS. prefix
the following distich :
‘Me lege si linguam cupias
cognoscere Bede,
Me quicunque capit, rustici-
tate caret.’
² Librum de o. alfabeti or-
dine distinctum. This work
was used both by Alcuin and
W. M. The latter says of Bede ε
‘ qui reliquis commodius in hoc
elaborauit, quia, quod illi confuse
