703. DE TEMPORIBUS.
708. EPIsToLA AD PLEGWINUM APOLOGETICA DE SEX AETA-
TIBUS SAECULL

The dates of these two works are mutually dependent,
and therefore they must be considered together. The latter
is addressed to Plegwin, a monk of Hexham ¹, in answer to
an absurd charge of heresy which had been brought against
Bede ‘a lasciuientibus rusticis . . . per pocula‚' in con-
nexion with the De Temporibus. Opp. i. 144. This, he
says, was written ‘ante quinquennium.' Ib. 145. And
he begs that his defence may be read ‘coram uenerabili
Domino . . . Wilfrido antistite.’ The latter must there·
fore fall within the period 705 >< 709, during which Wil-
frid recovered the See of Hexha1n2. (H. E. v. 19 and
notes.) At the end of the De Temporibus Bede says:
‘Tiberius dehinc quintum egit annunr' Opp. vi. 138.
Tiberius 111 (Apsimarus) seized the throne in 698; his
fifth year therefore is 702-3. At the beginning of the
chapter Bede says: ‘Sexta aetas continet annos prae-
teritos DCCVIII ’ ; this is a mistake for Dec 111, the v being
wrongly inserted. Both these dates, viz. the fifth year of
Tiberius and the date 703 A. D.y occur in c. 14 of the work,
Opp. vi. 130, a passage which seems to have been over-
looked. This, then, is the date of the De Temporibus,
and the Letter to Plegwin is fixed to 708.

Before 705. VITA METRIOA CUDBERCTI.

This must be earlier than 705 as it speaks of Aldfrid of
Northumbria as still alive ε ‘nostrum regit inclitus
orbem,' c. 21 acl fin„ Opp. Min. p. 25. The De Tem-
porum Ratione, composed in 725, speaks of it as written
‘ante aliquot annos.' Opp. vi. 329. In H. E. iv. 26 [28],
