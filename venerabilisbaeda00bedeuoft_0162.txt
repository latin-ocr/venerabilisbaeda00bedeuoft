cxlviii Introduction: Appendioe I.

716. IN SAMUELEM¹.

Between Books iii and iv occurs the passage given
above (pp. xv, xvi), with reference to Ceolfrid’s departure.
Therefore Books i-iii were written before and Book iv
after June, 716. See the preceding entry. ⁸

716. DE MANsmNrBUs FILIORUM ISRAEL.

716, DE Eo QUOD AIT ISA1As ‘ET CLAUDENTUR,’ mc.
These two Epistles were written while Bede was

engaged on the In Samuelem, τ’. e. in 716, Opp. i. 198,

202 3 apparently in the interval between Books iii and iv.

Ib. 203. They werewritten in answer to questions put
by Acca.

After 716. HISTORIA ABBATUM.

This must be later than 716 as it narrates the death of
Ceolfrid and the election of Hwaetbert in that year.
From the fact that nothing is narrated after that date
it would not be safe to argue that it must have been
written soon after 716, as Bede might naturally feel
a delicaey in writing about the administration of Hwaet-
bert, who, as we saw (p. xiv), overlived him.

After 716. IN MARCUM.

This was written after the In Samuelem, Opp. x. 37,
which, as we have seen, was written in 716. The In
Luc-am had been written ‘ante annos plurimos.' Ib. 3.
Probably, therefore, it is some time later than 716.

About 720. V1TA SANCTI CUDBERCTI.

This cannot be later than 72 1 as it is dedicated to Ead-
frid, Bishop of Lindisfarne, who died in that year. On
the other hand, it cannot be much earlier, as the De
Temporum rai-'ona composed in 725, speaks of it as
written ‘nuper.' Opp. vi. 329.
