Chronozoyy of Bede’s Wrz'tz'nsss. cxlix

720. IN GENESIM ¹.

In the course of the work Bede says : ‘ Si enim hodi-
erna die, uerbi gratia, per calendas Apriles esset luna
septima decima? Opp. vii. 117. 111 1115 chronological
works Bede takes his examples from the actual year in
which he is writing, vi. 130, 244, 249, 256. It is there-
fore probable that- he is doing the same here 3 if 50, 11115
0111011011 would fix it to the year 720, which would suit
very well. It must be before 731, as it is included in the
list of his works, Η. Ε. v. 24. It must be after 709 as it
is dedicated ‘antistiti Accae? Opp. vii. 1. (‘Abbati,’
Opp. i. 169, is probably a mere misprint of Dr. Giles.
It has misled Dr. Bright, p. 402.) The calculation of
the year from the criteria was made for 1110 by my friend
Mr. T. A. Archer, the historian of the Crusades.

Before 725. ΒΕ RATIONE 1315551111.

Τ1115 was incorporated in the De Temporum Ratione
(see above, p. xxxvii), and must therefore be anterior 10 11.
There 15 nothing to show by how much it preceded it.
Bede, in incorporating it, merely says : ‘ In epistola . . .
quondam dixi? Opp. vi. 222.

Before 725. DE NATURA RERUM. ”

Τ1115 15 earlier than the De Temporum Ratione, as it 15
011οᾶ 111 1110 preface to that work, where it is coupled
with the De Temporibus: ‘duos quondam . . . libellos
composui.' Opp. vi. 139. But because the two works
are coupled together it would hardly be safe to assume
that they were composed at the same time.

725. DE TEMPORUM RAT10NE2.

That 11115 work was written in 725 15 shown by the
mention of that year no less than three times in
the course of it, 00. 49, 52, 58; Opp. vi. 244, 249, 256;
