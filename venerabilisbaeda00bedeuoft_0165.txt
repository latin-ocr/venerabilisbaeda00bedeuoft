C'lzronoloqy of Bede's ertinys. cli

fore must have been written on its completion in 731.
It is prefixed to the text of the present edition.

731. HisromA EccrnsrAsricA.

The date is given by Bede himself, H. E. v. 23 acl fin.
Cf. v. 11 ad fin. and note acl Ioc.¹ On the difficulty con-
nected with the mention of the Saracen defeat in v. 23,
see note ad loc.

731 >< 735. RETRACTATIONES IN ACTA.

That this is later than 731 is probable from the fact
that it is not mentioned in the list of Bede’s works, H. E.
v. 24, though Ι have admitted above (p. xlix) that this
argument is not absolutely conclusive. It was written
‘plures annos ⁹ after the original Commentary on the Acts,

Opp. xii. 96,
November 5, 734. ErisTOLA AD ECGBERCTUM.

See the notes to the last section of the Epistle.

I cannot see that there are any materials for dating the
following works of Bede further than that being men-
tioned in the H. E. they must be earlier than 73 1.

DE L001s SANcns.

This is not mentioned in the list, H. E. v. 24, but it is
cited ib. 17, where Bede says that it had been written
‘ dudum‚’ a very vague expression. Ι cannot see on what
grounds Grehle⁷ p. 101, fixes it definitely to 701 >< 702.

¹ R. W. says: ‘DCCXXV. Beda
. . . Anglorum historiam incho-
auit, qui laudabiliter inchoatam
et feliciter consummatam regi
ceolwlfo praesentauit‚' i. 214.
It is possible that Bede may have
beyun the H. E. in 7253 though

Ι know of no evidence for it.
But it is more probable that the
statement rests on a confusion
between the H. E. and the De
Temporum Ratione, With its
Chronicle, which does belong to

725·
