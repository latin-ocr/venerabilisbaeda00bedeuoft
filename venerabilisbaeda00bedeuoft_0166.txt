IN PRovERmA ¹.

The De Muliere Forti often found in MSS.² and
editions as a separate treatise is really only the last part
of this commentary.

IN CANTICA CANTICORUM3.

The seventh book, which is a mere cento of passages
extracted from St. Gregory, is sometimes found separ-
ately, e. ρ. Ms. Coll. Trin. Oxon, No. 52, f. 188 b ; so is the
first book, under the title ‘ Contra Iulianum diuine gratie
1·epug1iatore1n‚’ C·{l· MS. Phillips⁷ 9428. ’

IN CANTICUM HABACCUC.

Dedicated to ‘dilectissima in Christo soror.’ I cannot
agree With Werner, p. 180, in thinking that by this an
actual sister of Bede’s is meant. Some abbess or nun is
probably indicated.

IN LIBRUM BEATI TOBIAE ⁴².

THE MARTYROLOGY5.

The Martyrology as we have it has been so added
to, that it is impossible to tell What part, if any, is
really due to Bede. And there is much in it that one
would willingly believe not to be Bede’s——too much
ecclesiastica] gloating over the physica] horrors of mar-
tyrdom, and legends of the purely silly kind. On the
so-called poetical Martyrology‚ see below, p. clviii.
