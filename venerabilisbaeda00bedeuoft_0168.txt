cliv Introduction: Appcndioe I.

Giles, Opp. i. 103, S. D. ii. 27 gives the following lines,
which, if genuine (as they have every appearance of
being), are almost conclusive asto the authorship, and
show that the poem was written at Acca’s request‚ and,
as he is called ⁴ pater,’ after his elevation to the episcopate
in 709 :

⁴ En tua iussa sequens cecini tibi carmina fiendI,

Tu tua sac promissa, precor, sermone fideli

Commendans precibus Christo modo, meque canentem.

Viue Deo felix, et dic, nale, fratribus almis,

Acca pater, trepidi et pauidi reminiscere serui.'
(There is an Anglo-Saxon version, edited for the E. E. T. S.
by Dr. Lumby in 1876, which has neither termination.)

EPIGRAMMATA ¹.
The ‘epigrammata ’ as a collection are not known to

exist. Possibly the little poem in Vit. Cudb. o. 42, Opp.

Min. pp. 130, 131, which Bede cites with a ‘quondam

dixj,' may have belonged to it. The lines which precede

the ‘ In Apocalypsin ⁹ are called ‘ Epigramma Bedae.’ Opp.

xii. 342. “

EPISTOLA AD WICREDAM DE AEQUINocrio VERNALI mXTA
ANATOLIUM.

The date given towards the end of the letter is 776 (l).
Opp. i. 163. Either, therefore, the whole passage is
interpolated (so Giles, Pref. p. clxxv), or the numbers are
corrupt, or some later scribe has altered the number to
suit the year in which he copied the work.

VITA SANCTI FELICIS.
This is merely a prose rendering of Paulinus’ metrical
Life. Cf. the reference to Paulinus’ work in the Mar—

tyrology. Opp. iv. 22.
VrrA SANCTI ANAsrAsn.

This was a mere correction of a bad translation from
the Greek. It is not known to exist.

¹ This is one of the works of have sent to him. Mon. Mog.
Bede which Lullus asked to p. 289.
