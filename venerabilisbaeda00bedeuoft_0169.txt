EXCERPTS FROM ST. JEROME: ‘IN ISAIAM, DANIHELEM.
XII PRoPHETAs, ET PARTEM HIEREMIAE.'

Ι have not met with this. Gehle (p. 60) gives refer-
ences to authors who have cited it.

CAPITULA LEcrroNUM on various books of the Old Testa—
ment.

According to Gehle (pp. 62, 63) those on Genesis and
Kings in the printed editions of Cologne and Basle may
be genuine. The rest he pronounces spurious. I have
not examined them myself. Bede seems to have pro-

jected a regular commentary on the Pentateuch. Opp- ix.
343 x. 330-

⁴ The work printed with this title and found in many
MSS. is not by Bede, but by Florus Lugdunensis. The
genuine work does, however, exist in MS. ; one MS. is at
Troyes, according to Giles, Opp. xii. pp. x—xii; another
is at Monte Casino, No. 178 (see Bibliotheca Casinensis,
vol. iv, under that number, where also an edition of it is
promised, which, as far as Ι know, has not yet appeared ²).

 

¹ These two works are prob-
ably referred to by Lupus, Abbot
of Pei-rara, in a letter to Altsig,
Abbot of York, under the title
‘Bedae . . . Quaestiones in utrum-
que Testamentum? H. & S. iii.
635. St. Boniface asks Arch-
bishop Egbert to send him ‘Beda
super lectionarium anniuersa-
rium? lb. 3893 Mon. Mog. p.
250.

² It is interesting to find that

in the twelfth century Robert
de Monte, or de Torigny, Abbot
of ‘St. Michael in the peril of
the Sea’ (Mont St. Michel), dis-
cussed the authorship of two
collections, which may probably
be identified with the two
named above. Cf. Prologus
