These are all the works of Bede for the genuineness of
which we have the security of his own authority. To
‹liscuss the character and authorship of the various works
which have been attributed to him in MSS. and editions
would be an endless task, and cannot be attempted here.
1 mention only those few with reference to which Ι have

something to say.

THE PENITENTIAL.

This is accepted as genuine by H. Sc S. iii. 326—3343
l). G. A. ii. 1614; Wasserschleben, Bussordnungen,
pp. 220—230. Werner simply shelters himself under
WVasserschleben’s authority, and does not discuss the
question independently (pp. 93, 94).

Bede nowhere mentions it himself ; and the fact that
It is found, apparently, only in continental MSS.¹, and
that in some of them the name of the author is given in
the genitive as ‘Bedani ' 01· ‘Pethanr’ might incline us
to ascribe it rather to some Irish continental monk
named Baedan or Baeithin. The argument from the
form of the name cannot, however, be pressed, as the

genitive ⁴ Beclani²⁹ occurs in the S. Gallen copy of the

D'Aehery’s edition of the works
of Guibert de Negent, p. 716, 1-6-
printed in Migne, Pat. Lat. ccii.
Robert assigns the shorter work
to Bede. The longer one he,
following Cassiodorus (De Di-
uinis Lit. c. 8), assigns to a Petrus
abbas Tripolitanae prouinciae,'
and from it he made his own
abbreviation. Cf. Lupus of Fer-
rara to Hincmar, Epist. 76:
‘Collectaneum Bedae in Apos-
tolum ex operibus Augustini
ueritus sum dirigere, propterea
quod. tantus est liber, ut nec
sinu celari, nec pera posset satis
commode contineri. Quamquam
si alterutrum fieret, formidanda

esset obuia improborum rapa-
citas, quam profecto pulchri-
tudo ipsius codicis accendisset.'
