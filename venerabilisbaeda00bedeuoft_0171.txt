letter of Cuthbert on Bede's death (below, p. clxiv), and
such forms are not uncommon, and are due to the influ-
ence of the weak Anglo-Saxon genitive ‘Bedan.' In the
nominative it is ‘Baeda’ (ib. p. clx). Nor must- the
evident Irish affinities of the penitentia] be unduly
pressed, for the Irish influence on the Northumbrian
Church was strong ¹ (above, p. xxx).

A stronger argument is that in the penitential of
Archbishop Egbert the author, while acknowledging his
obligations to Gregory and Theodore, makes no mention
of Bede; which, seeing that Bede was his own master.
he could hardly fail to do, had Bede written a penitential.
H. Sc S. iii. 418.

Another fac-t which points the same way is that Bede.
who says so much about the work of Theodore, never
even alludes to his penitential, which, considering its
importance, would certainly be strange if he were himself
interested in such literature ².

The penitential ascribed to Bede is a mere collection of
extracts from earlier works including Theodore’s3 and
Wasserschleben himself, who accepts Bede’s author-ship.
is constrained to ask why Bede should have made such
a meagre compilation when Theodore’s work was in
existence (aa. s. p. 39).

On the whole the arguments are against Bede's author-
ship, and we should be thankful to believe that Bede had
had nothing to do with such a matter. The penitentia]
literature is in truth a deplorable feature of the mediaeval
