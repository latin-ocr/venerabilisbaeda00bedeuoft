clviii Introduction .· Appemlz'ae I.

Church ¹. Evil deedS, the imagination of which may
perhaps have dimly floated through our minds in our
darkest moments, are here tabulated and reduced to
system. It is hard to see how any one could busy him-
self with such literature and not be the worse for it.

DF, Tonrrams,

Opp. iv. 343-348, is a most contemptible work, and
clearly spurious.
DE MINUTIONE SANGUINIS.

Less obviously spurious, and might possibly be by
Bede. Ib. 349—352 3 cf. H. E. v. 3.
DE SciHSMATmUs.

Mentioned in Giles’s second Life. Opp. Ι. clxii. This
is probably a mere mistake of scribe or printer for De
Schematibus⁷ on which see above, p. cxlv.

CUCULUS, SIVE szrs ET HIEMIs CONFLICTUS.

A hexameter poem, a sort of eclogue-—unlike any of
Bede’s other works. Opp. i. 35-37. It may be genuine.
But in Dummler, Poetae Lat. Aeui Caroling. i. 270, it is
printed among Alcuin’s works; and this is probably
right ².

PAssro SANCTI Iesum MARTYRIS.

A hexameter poem. Certainly spurious. Opp. i. 38—49.

MARTYROLOGIUM POETICUM.

A hexameter poem. Certainly spurious. It mentions
the death of Wilfrid II, who died in 744 or 745. Ib.
50-53. Werner, however, accepts it as genuine, treating
the verses on Wilfrid as an interpolation (pp. 102, 146).

iii. 367, iv. 932. to his disciples.’ H. & S. iii. 508,
